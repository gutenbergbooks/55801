<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c1"><br />THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE</h2>
<p>Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a
nightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.
After recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously
at himself. &ldquo;Here I was picked as the
most stable of a group of two hundred cadets,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;and chosen to make man&rsquo;s first trip into
space, yet I&rsquo;m shaking like a leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got out of bed and went over to the window.
From his father&rsquo;s temporary apartment, he could
see distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into
space tomorrow night. He had been awarded the
frightening honor of making that trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,
Arizona&rsquo;s, double-decked streets, elevated over one
another to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying
stop lights, he thought back over the years; to
the 1950&rsquo;s, when mice and monkeys were sent up
in Vikings to launch mankind&rsquo;s first probing of the
mysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites
were launched; to the 1960&rsquo;s, when huger,
multiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem
of escape velocity; to 1975&mdash;today&mdash;when man
was finally ready to send one of his own kind into
the uninhabited deeps.</p>
<p>Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would
not come.</p>
<p>In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps
of mother and father. By their sound he knew
they were the footsteps of worried people. This
hurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.</p>
<p>The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when
he had first signed up for space-cadet training. They
had known there was an extremely high percentage
of washouts, and after each test he passed, they had
pretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly
they had hoped he would fail, for they were
aware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists
were working for&mdash;the goal that had just now been
reached.</p>
<p>Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted
until morning.</p>
<p>He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got
up, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,
and tugged on the polished gray boots. He
took one final look around his room as though in
farewell, then went out to the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to
act as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending
to enjoy his morning paper, nodding only
casually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring
scrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn&rsquo;t a very
good actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped
her eyes with her free hand.</p>
<p>The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had
to be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three
of them sat down at the table, still speaking in
monosyllables and of unimportant things. They
made a pretense of eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mom,&rdquo; Dad suddenly said with a forced
jollity that was intended to break the tension, &ldquo;the
Farnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they don&rsquo;t send an older man!&rdquo;
Mom burst out, as though she had been holding it
in as long as she could. &ldquo;Sending a boy who isn&rsquo;t
even twenty-two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are different nowadays, Mom,&rdquo; Dad explained,
still with the assumed calmness that
masked his real feelings. &ldquo;These days, men grow
up faster and mature quicker. They&rsquo;re stronger and
more alert than older men&mdash;&rdquo; His voice trailed off
as if he were unable to convince himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some</i>body has to go,&rdquo; Marsh said. &ldquo;Why not a
younger man without family and responsibility?
That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re giving younger men more opportunities
today than they used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not younger men I&rsquo;m talking about!&rdquo; Mom
blurted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Marsh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Now, Ruth, we promised not to get excited
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Mom said weakly. &ldquo;But Marsh is too
young to&mdash;&rdquo; She caught herself and put her hand
over her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking like that!&rdquo; Dad said. &ldquo;Marsh is
coming back. There&rsquo;ve been thousands of rockets
sent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that
every bug has been ironed out before risking a
man&rsquo;s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going
up in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn&rsquo;t it,
Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Dad,&rdquo; Marsh murmured.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each
brooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed
to take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things
that he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable
feeling, almost as if he were seeing these
things for the last as well as the first time.</p>
<p>Finally the airport came into view. The guards
at the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the
Farnsworth car through ahead of scores of others
that crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers
slipped up close and shot off flash bulbs
in Marsh&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had
been taken over by the Air Force in recent years
and converted into the largest rocket experimental
center in the United States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Dad drove up to the building that would be the
scene of Marsh&rsquo;s first exhaustive tests and briefings.
He stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their
good-by was brief. Marsh saw his father&rsquo;s mouth
quiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He
had gone through any number of grueling tests to
prove that he could take the rigors of space, but
not one of them had prepared him for the hardest
moments of parting.</p>
<p>When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first
to the psychiatrist who checked his condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re excited, aren&rsquo;t you, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Marsh admitted. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve got
the wrong man, sir. I might fail them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor grinned. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have the wrong
man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They might have, with a so-called
iron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension
and fears until later, until maybe the moment of
blast-off. Then he&rsquo;d let go, and when he needed his
calmest judgment he wouldn&rsquo;t have it. No, Marshall,
there isn&rsquo;t a man alive who could make this
history-making flight without some anxiety. Forget
it. You&rsquo;ll feel better as the day goes on. I&rsquo;ll see you
once more before the blast-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to
the space surgeon, was given a complete physical
examination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.
Then began his review briefing on everything
he would encounter during the flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half
before midnight. Since at night, in the Western
Hemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications
of excessive temperatures in the outer
reaches were avoided during the time Marsh would
be outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small
upper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first
two parts would be jettisoned after reaching their
peak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would
carry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around
Earth, along the route that a permanent space station
was to be built after the results of the flight
were studied. After spending a little while in this
orbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey
back to Earth, in gliding flight.</p>
<p>He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When
an officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had
been lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,
Chief of Space Operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time, son,&rdquo; the officer said. &ldquo;Your
CO wants to see you in the outside office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marsh went into the adjoining room and found
his cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an
unusual warmth about the severe gentleman who
previously had shown only a firm, uncompromising
attitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,
and his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close
to his head in regulation neatness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is it, Marshall,&rdquo; the colonel said.
&ldquo;How I envy you this honor of being the first human
to enter space. However, I do feel that a part
of me is going along too, since I had a small share
in preparing you for the trip. If the training was
harsh at times, I believe that shortly you will
understand the reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel that the Colonel was either too soft
or strict, sir,&rdquo; Marsh said diplomatically.</p>
<p>A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared
loudly in the cool desert night: &ldquo;X minus forty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk all night, Marshall,&rdquo; the colonel
said briskly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a job to do. But first, a few
of your friends want to wish you luck.&rdquo; He called
into the anteroom, &ldquo;You may come in, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There filed smartly into the room ten youths who
had survived the hard prespace course with Marsh
and would be his successors in case he failed tonight.
They formed a line and shook hands with
Marsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten
sick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G&rsquo;s,
then had rallied to pass the test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Marsh,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been
certain he would wash out during navigation phase
in the planetarium. &ldquo;All the luck in the world,
Marsh,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Each cadet brought back a special memory of his
training as they passed before him, wishing him
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>When they had gone and the speaker outside
had announced: &ldquo;X minus thirty minutes,&rdquo; the
colonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.
Colonel Tregasker was to be Marsh&rsquo;s escort to
the ship.</p>
<p>Photographers and newspapermen swarmed
about them as they climbed into the jeep that was
to take them to the launching site farther out on
the field. Questions were flung at the two from all
sides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep
through the mob and sped off over the asphalt.</p>
<p>At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the
police had their hands full keeping out thousands
of spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off
area. The field was choked with a tide of humanity
milling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,
both at the airport and in other parts of
Phoenix, directed spears of light on the towering
rocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.
There was one light, far larger than the rest,
with powerful condensing lenses and connected to
a giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh
home from his trip among the stars.</p>
<p>A high wire fence surrounded the launching
ramp and blockhouses. International scientists and
dignitaries with priorities formed a ring around
the fence, but even they were not allowed inside
the small circle of important activity. The guards
waved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the
tiny third stage in which he was to spend his time
aloft, but he had never been close to the completely
assembled ship until this moment. The three stages
had been nicknamed, &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo;
Marsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of
the great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions
to perfect and was as high as a four-story
building.</p>
<p>The gigantic base, &ldquo;Big Tom,&rdquo; was the section
that would have the hardest job to do, that of
thrusting the rocket through the densest part of the
atmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than
the other sections. Marsh knew that most of the
ship&rsquo;s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of
hydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going into that blockhouse over there,&rdquo;
Colonel Tregasker said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll don your space gear
in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened
to the cadet&rsquo;s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.
Marsh knew this to be one of the most important
phases of the flight&mdash;to find out a man&rsquo;s reaction to
space flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each
wire would telemeter certain information by radio
back to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had
been put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and
rubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,
and then he was ready except for his helmet, which
would not be donned until later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The
open-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the
big latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.
The two got into the cage, and it rose with them.
Marsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension
during the activities of the day, but his knees felt
rubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried
him high above the noisy confusion of the airport.
<i>This was it.</i></p>
<p>As they stepped from the cage onto the platform
of the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below
call out: &ldquo;X minus twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were eleven engineers and workmen on
the platform readying the compartment that Marsh
would occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and
alone as he faced the small chamber that might
very well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and
wires were staggering in their complexity.</p>
<p>Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.
&ldquo;Good-by, sir,&rdquo; he said in a quavering voice.
&ldquo;I hope I remember everything the Corps taught
me.&rdquo; He tried to smile, but his facial muscles
twitched uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, son&mdash;lots of it,&rdquo; the officer said
huskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced
the youth with a firm, fatherly hug. &ldquo;This is not
regulations,&rdquo; he mumbled gruffly, &ldquo;but hang regulations!&rdquo;
He turned quickly and asked to be carried
down to the ground.</p>
<p>A man brought Marsh&rsquo;s helmet and placed it
over his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs
on the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,
pressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and
headpiece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small
compartment. He reclined in the soft contour
chair, and the straps were fastened by one of the
engineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires
connected to various parts of his body had been
brought together into a single unit in the helmet.
A wire cable leading from the panel was plugged
into the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.</p>
<p>Final tests were run off to make sure everything
was in proper working order, including the two-way
short-wave radio that would have to penetrate the
electrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch
air lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,
Marsh could hear the final minutes and seconds
being called off from inside the blockhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything O.K.?&rdquo; Marsh was asked by someone
on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Marsh replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re on your own,&rdquo; were the final ominous
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X minus five minutes,&rdquo; called the speaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could
remember. He was painfully aware of his cramped
quarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath
him that presently would literally blow him
sky-high. And he thought of the millions of people
the world over who, at this moment, were hovering
at radios and TV&rsquo;s anxiously awaiting the dawn of
the space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,
lost in that multitude of night watchers, and among
the few who were not primarily concerned with the
scientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if
he would ever see them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X minus sixty seconds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent
up, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of
smoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear
trying to master him, he began reviewing all the
things he must remember and, above all, what to
do in an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X minus ten seconds&mdash;five&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;FIRE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.</p>
<p>The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer
than the gradually built up speed of the whirling
centrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into
his contour chair. It felt as though someone were
pressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in
his body were clinging to his backbone. But these
first moments would be the worst. A gauge showed
a force of 7 G&rsquo;s on him&mdash;equal to half a ton.</p>
<p>He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial
in front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each
Mach number represented that much times the
speed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an
hour.</p>
<p>Marsh knew &ldquo;Big Tom&rdquo; would blast for about a
minute and a half under control of the automatic
pilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude
of twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a
metal mesh &rsquo;chute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Marsh&rsquo;s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature
gauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below
zero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached
twenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square
of view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of
the cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.</p>
<p>Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He
heard a rumble and felt a jerk. &ldquo;Big Tom&rdquo; was
breaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully
overcome, and the ship had already begun tilting
into its trajectory.</p>
<p>There was a new surge of agony on his body as
the second stage picked up the acceleration at a
force of 7 G&rsquo;s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the
force pulled his lips back from his teeth and
dragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers
continued to rise&mdash;11, 12, 13&mdash;to altitude 200
miles, the outer fringe of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
There was a slight lifting of the pressure on his
body. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but
the sky was getting purple.</p>
<p>Mach 14&mdash;10,000 miles an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick&rdquo; would jettison any moment. Marsh had
been aloft only about four minutes, but it had
seemed an age, every tortured second of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>There was another rumble as the second stage
broke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath
him as his own occupied section, &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; began
blasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully
weathered those tons of exploding hydrazine
and acid that could have reduced him to nothing
if something had gone wrong. Although his
speed was still building up, the weight on him
began to ease steadily as his body&rsquo;s inertia finally
yielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.</p>
<p>The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the
peak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.
His altitude was 350 miles&mdash;man&rsquo;s highest ascent.
Slowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.
Marsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as
the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; fuel was spent and rocket &ldquo;Harry&rdquo; began
its free-flight orbit around Earth.</p>
<p>The ship had reached a speed which exactly
counterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,
theoretically, travel this way forever, provided no
other outside force acted upon it. The effect on
Marsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved
of the viselike pressure, his stomach and
chest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cadet Farnsworth,&rdquo; the voice of General Forsythe
spoke into his helmet receiver, &ldquo;are you all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Marsh replied. &ldquo;That is, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was good to hear a human voice again, something
to hold onto in this crazy unreal world into
which he had been hurtled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting the electronic readings from your
gauges O.K.,&rdquo; the voice went on. &ldquo;The doctor says
your pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was queer having your pulse read from 350
miles up in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly
in the &ldquo;air.&rdquo; A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed
this. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature
and wind velocity outside might have astounded
him if he were not prepared for the readings.
The heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,
and the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But
these figures meant nothing because of the sparseness
of air molecules. Temperature and wind applied
only to the individual particles, which were
thousands of feet apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your cosmic-ray count?&rdquo; asked the general.</p>
<p>Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel
from which clicking sounds were coming. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s low,
sir. Nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations
known, were the only radiation in space that could
not be protected against. But in small doses they
had been found not to be dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as our recorders get more of the figures
your telemeter is giving us,&rdquo; the operations chief
said, &ldquo;you can leave the rocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,
he eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.
He could hardly contain his excitement at being
the first person to view the globe of Earth from
space. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of
zero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it
took some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly
strange sensation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>He had disconnected the cable leading from his
helmet to the ship&rsquo;s transmitter and switched on
the ship&rsquo;s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph
the area covered by &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; Then he was
ready to go outside. He pressed a button on the
wall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated
into the narrow alcove and closed the door in the
cramped chamber behind him. He watched a
gauge, and when it showed normal pressure and
temperature again, he opened the outside hatch,
closing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the
vacuum of space to contact the interior of the
ship&rsquo;s quarters, delicate instruments would have
been ruined by the sudden decompression and loss
of heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship
so that there was no chance of his becoming separated
from it.</p>
<p>Then he looked &ldquo;downward,&rdquo; to experience the
thrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the
panorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A
downy blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the
whole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating
like phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness
of the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for
Marsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities
extending from horizon to horizon. It gave him
an exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew
it was largely his own and the rocket&rsquo;s fast speed
that was responsible for the illusion. As he hung
in this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for
his cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,
developed only in recent years, simulated
the weightlessness of space and trained the cadets
for endurance in such artificial conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe some of the things you see, Marshall,&rdquo;
General Forsythe said over Marsh&rsquo;s helmet receiver.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just cut in a recorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a scene almost beyond description, sir,&rdquo;
Marsh said into the helmet mike. &ldquo;The sky is
thickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very
distinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that
must be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars
is like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon
is so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct
sun does on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond
the ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.
He believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at
a speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported
this to the general.</p>
<p>As he brought his eyes down from the more distant
fixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a
strange thing happened. He was suddenly seized
with a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity
training had been intended to prepare him against
this very thing. A cold sweat come out over his
body, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to
take hold of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He made a sudden movement as though to catch
himself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in
frictionless space and his own weightlessness, he
was shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a
cracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and
then sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,
head foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,
exposing his body to decompression, causing him
to swell like a balloon and finally explode.</p>
<p>In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment
did he have the presence of mind to flip
his body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up
in front of him for protection. His feet bumped
against the rocket&rsquo;s side, and the motion sent him
hurtling back out to the end of the safety line
again. This back-and-forth action occurred several
times before he could stop completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be careful,&rdquo; he panted to himself,
as he thought of how close his space career had
come to being ended scarcely before it had begun.</p>
<p>General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering
what had happened. When Marsh had explained
and the general seemed satisfied that Marsh
had recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his
description.</p>
<p>His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked
down calmly, entranced as the features of the
United States passed below his gaze. He named the
cities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,
lakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked
from 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour&rsquo;s
time, the rocket had traversed the entire country
and was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence
of the Atlantic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Marsh asked if &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; had landed
safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tom&rsquo; landed near Roswell, New Mexico,&rdquo; General
Forsythe told him, &ldquo;and the &rsquo;chute of the second
section has been reported seen north of Dallas.
I think you&rsquo;d better start back now, Marshall. It&rsquo;ll
take us many months to analyze all the information
we&rsquo;ve gotten. We can&rsquo;t contact you very well on the
other side of the world either, and thirdly, I don&rsquo;t
want you exposed to the sun&rsquo;s rays outside the
atmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer
than can be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and
floated slowly back toward the ship. He entered
the air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his
contour chair to upright position, facing the console
of the ship&rsquo;s manual controls for the glide
Earthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet
cable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.</p>
<p>Since he was still moving at many thousands of
miles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge
straight downward. He and the glider would be
turned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would
have to spend considerable time soaring in and out
of the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he
reached much lower speed. Then the Earth&rsquo;s gravitational
pull would do the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,
and the most dangerous. Where before,
Marsh had depended on automatic controls to
guide him, now much of the responsibility was on
his own judgment. He remembered the many
hours he had sweated through to log his flying
time. Now he could look back on that period in his
training and thank his lucky stars for it.</p>
<p>He took the manual controls and angled into the
atmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial&mdash;the
atmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had
neared the dangerous incendiary point, with the
ship having literally become red-hot, he soared into
the frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this
up a long time in order to reduce his devastating
speed.</p>
<p>It was something of a shock to him to leave the
black midnight of Earth&rsquo;s slumbering side for the
brilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe
and Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He
would have liked to study this other half of the
world which he had glimpsed only a few times before
in his supersonic test flights, but he knew this
would have to wait for future flights.</p>
<p>Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed
enough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than
the rocket&rsquo;s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.
At this point, Marsh cut in &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s&rdquo; forward
braking jets to check his falling speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else to worry about,&rdquo; he
thought to himself. &ldquo;Will old Harry hold together
or will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The directional radio signals from the powerful
Skyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as
Marsh neared the shores of California. He could
see the winking lights of San Diego and Los
Angeles, and farther inland the swinging thread
that was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his
path of flight had been grounded for the past few
hours because of the space flight. The only ground
light scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon
in Phoenix.</p>
<p>When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling
downward over the state to kill the rest of his
altitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a
hurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through
the night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped
summits of the towering San Francisco
Peaks on the drive southward, and he recognized
the sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then
he was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed
sand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature
of the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage
done to the walls and instruments, and possibly
to other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside
controls might be too warped to give him a
good touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely
at all.</p>
<p>A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing
gear. Now the only problem left was to land
himself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow
parallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport
several times as his altitude continued to plummet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel
was gone now. From here on in, he would be on
gliding power alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy does it, Marshall,&rdquo; the general said quietly
into his ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lining up fine. Level it out a
little and keep straight with the approach lights.
That&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re just about in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at
him, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground
on the west end of the runway. He kept the ship
steady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing
the last of its once tremendous velocity. The
plane hit the restraining wire across the strip and
came to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against
the single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,
the ship was still and he was safe.</p>
<p>He unfastened his strap and removed his space
helmet. The heat of the compartment brought the
sweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and
pressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door
flew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth
which he had wondered if he would ever inhale
again.</p>
<p>His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,
as men swarmed over him with congratulations,
eager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters&rsquo;
flash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new
Lindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground
and mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue
and pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.
Then only three men were allowed
through the cordon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The first to reach him was General Forsythe, who
almost seemed to have ridden with him the whole
way. He grabbed Marsh&rsquo;s hand and clapped him on
the shoulder. He said briefly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve launched the
age of space travel, Marshall. Congratulations, son.
Now go home with your father and get a good
night&rsquo;s rest. We&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; Marsh replied.</p>
<p>Colonel Tregasker came forward, and there was
moisture visible in the eyes of the cadet officer.
&ldquo;Now that one of my boys has made the first trip
into space and fulfilled a career-long dream, I can
retire in peace,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to have
been associated with you, Marshall Farnsworth.
Congratulations, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad had his turn. He stood for a moment
in front of his son as though undecided what to
do, hat in hand, the night breeze ruffling his hair.
Mr. Farnsworth seemed embarrassed by the grandeur
of the moment and reluctant to accept a part
in one of the greatest accomplishments of modern
times.</p>
<p>Marsh moved forward and clasped his shoulders.
&ldquo;I did it, Dad,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for bringing you back safely,&rdquo; his
father murmured huskily. &ldquo;Are you ready to go
home, son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Suddenly Marsh was terribly weary, and he felt
as if he could sleep for days. &ldquo;I am kind of tired,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home and see Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people around seemed to realize that this
was not their moment. They parted ranks quietly
as the father and his son walked through them and
got into their car. As they drove off, even the stars
and planets seemed to be standing silent and
watchful, in respect for the dawn of space travel
on the tiny pebble that was Earth.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c2"><br />MYSTERY EYES OVER EARTH</h2>
<p>Dr. Myron Lowenthal, gaunt, keen-eyed,
and sixty, shuffled over to the receptionist&rsquo;s desk
in an office in the Pentagon. Clutched tightly beneath
one spidery arm was a worn brief case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see Mr. Goodnight, miss?&rdquo; Dr. Lowenthal
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shall I say is calling, sir?&rdquo; the young
woman asked mechanically, not looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lowenthal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman&rsquo;s eyes lighted alertly as if the
name were of great significance to her. &ldquo;Of course,
Dr. Lowenthal. Mr. Goodnight is expecting you.
Go right in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>At the sight of Dr. Lowenthal and his brief case,
Mr. Goodnight rose slowly to his feet, his face reflecting
deep interest not unmixed with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you have finished the translation?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Dr. Lowenthal placed the brief case on the desk,
and Goodnight&rsquo;s fingers were far from steady as he
opened the case and pulled out top-secret manuscripts.</p>
<p>First he laid aside the sheaf of strange, charred
papers, each protected by a cellophane envelope.
The sheets were of very thin, amazingly tough material
of unknown substance, and they were covered
with tiny, neat hieroglyphics. The papers had been
found by a farm boy twelve months before in
Wickenburg, Arizona, and Dr. Lowenthal, archaeologist
and cryptographer, had been all this time
trying to decipher the hidden message.</p>
<p>Before reading the translation, Goodnight asked,
&ldquo;Is it your belief that this sheaf of papers was
dropped from a flying saucer, as we first thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; Lowenthal replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it good&mdash;or bad?&rdquo; Goodnight asked tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better read it, sir, and judge
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goodnight began reading the manuscript
translation:</p>

<hr /><p class="tb">FROM: Kal-Pota-Tekkala, Observer 13-J07, Group 507.</p>
<p>TO: Grand Council, Federation of the Triple Suns, Planet Ykaa, Takarala Sector GZ-5000-7076, Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Planets of Sun 00836-Y, Specifically, Third Takarala Sector GZ-5000-7070.</p>
<p>Planet Called Earth, Charaan Year 37,811.</p>
<p>It is now my tenth year of observation in the planetary
group called the solar system. In this brief report I
shall review somewhat randomly a few of the things I
have witnessed on Earth, only planet of intelligent life
in this system and therefore the only world of interest
to us in the Federation.</p>
<p>I arrived in the Earth year 1947. (What a youthful
civilization this is, but about average in their development
as compared to some 28,000 other worlds the
Federation has so far observed.) I pride myself on being
among the first of us (Group 507) to be detected
by Earthmen in recent times. This was, of course, the
sighting by one Kenneth Arnold near Mt. Rainier in
America, the most advanced country of Earth. Our receivers
picked up the newscast of the sighting and translated.
Arnold&rsquo;s description of having seen what looked
like &ldquo;saucers&rdquo; led to our craft being thereafter named
&ldquo;flying saucers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after this sighting, our receivers told us that
nearly all the nations of Earth had taken up the cry
of &ldquo;Saucers! Saucers!&rdquo; Indeed, the men of Earth must
truly have been overwhelmed by the abundance of our
craft in the sky at this time when our greatest concentration
of observers viewed the planet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>It is hard to realize that many Earth inhabitants still
doubt that there are other planets of habitation beside
their own in the universe. (This is an opinion formed
from reports of news commentators.) Yet how they can
close their minds to such a fact, when they know that
there are many billions of suns and planets, is beyond
my comprehension. Of course, Earth has been an island
to itself since the beginning of its civilization, and
since they have not even yet ventured into space, I can
understand their skepticism somewhat.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this skepticism of Earthmen is remarkable.
Yes, even after the evidence of our heavy concentration
of craft in their skies for ten years (at our latest
visit), many even now doubt our reality. This is in
spite of our near collisions with Earth craft reported by
reputable witnesses (especially the Chiles-Whitted episode
near Montgomery, Alabama, United States of
America). Yet those who do believe in us are very
stanch supporters, and I have heard newscasters say
there have been some convincing books written on the
subject. Some day&mdash;when we make contact&mdash;all must
surely believe.</p>
<p>Earth is a planet of many races and different political
groups. Although an effort is being made for co-operation
through an organization called United Nations
(not to be confused with United States), there is no
real, enforceable unity among the countries of Earth.
The planet has not even advanced to the point of a
common tongue! Without being able to speak the
same language, there is too much opportunity for misunderstanding,
and this must be one of the causes of
the deplorable bloodshed this planet has gone through
in its history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>It is good to know that democracy presently seems
to hold the balance of power on Earth. The world
leader, America, has been a champion of democracy
since its colonization by Europeans, and perhaps it has
saved Earth from total disaster by intervention on two
occasions in recent years.</p>
<p>There is one major threat to the democratic life of
Earth. This is the nation of Russia, located in the
Eurasian area. Its leaders have taken to the archaic
system of totalitarianism. But at the present time the
democracies are so strong that Russia appears hesitant
to take the path of conquest. Besides this, I believe all
realize that Earth cannot stand another world war because
of the frightful nuclear weapons that would be
used. In such a war there would be no victor, only
losers and world destruction.</p>
<p>If Earth avoids the pitfall of major warfare, I believe
she is on the threshold of great things. Even now
she is launching satellites into space in the first step
toward space travel. The aircraft of Earth are attaining
greater speed, height, and maneuverability. They are
still slow and awkward, of course, compared to the
craft we have, but the engineers are learning, even as
we had to do thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Since Earthmen have still not gone into space, there
has been no experimentation on craft utilizing force
fields, but after observing our craft for the past ten
years, I am sure the scientists have come up with some
theories as to how we get about. They are baffled by
our motions that seem to defy the laws of physics. They
report that no living person can withstand the abrupt
turns and acceleration of which we are capable. When
they have utilized the cosmic rays of space and understand
that a force field will permit a flyer to spin and
soar with his craft, without distress of any kind, then
they will have unlocked the key to what they believe
to be a dark mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Their attempts to overtake us in their jet craft have
been laughable. I often wonder what they would do if
we should suddenly stop and dare them to approach
closer. Should they fire on us, it would undoubtedly
fill them with fear and dismay to see their shots bounce
harmlessly off our force field.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that the more prosperous races of the
planet are not the leaders that they could be. There is
much frivolity and lack of emotional discipline about
them, and few seem to employ their fullest mental
capabilities. Their radio and picture-radio are entirely
in the realm of entertainment, and formal education
seems to be largely abandoned after an Earthman has
passed his school years. Our receivers constantly pick
up, day in and day out, music of definite rhythms
which seem to be enjoying current popularity. These
melodies survive for only a few weeks, then new ones
take their place and are, in turn, played to their deaths.
There is a noble class of music that is heard less frequently
and usually at late hours. This never seems to
lose popularity, for some of our recorded pickups of
these long compositions have been compared with recordings
made some two hundred years ago by our
prior observers, and they are identical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Regarding the subject of frivolity, there is a deadly
&ldquo;game&rdquo; being played unceasingly across the pathways
of Earth, particularly in prosperous America. Although
not really a game, of course, I am reminded of one as
I see it going on. Each player is in control of a free
vehicle (or &ldquo;guided missile&rdquo; as I think of it), and he
attempts to survive by avoiding collision with another
player. Some are indifferent to the game and drive
their cars unexcitedly and with caution. Other players&mdash;and
there are many of them&mdash;appear to enjoy the
game very much and drive their &ldquo;weapons&rdquo; with reckless
haste and seeming indifference to their own safety
and the safety of others. Many of these players lose the
game, and their remains are carried away systematically.
It is very disturbing to see this bloody game going on
without end, and I should feel better if America would
abandon it in favor of travel of a less dangerous nature.
But they seem years away from a truly safe, fully
automatic car of our type with the electronic protection
shield.</p>
<p>While on the subject of fatality, it is with regret
that I heard of the disintegration of Paltaa-Vezek and
his craft some days ago. Paltaa and I were boys together
barely three hundred (Earth) years ago on the Symphony
Lake plantation. We went through sleep-absorption
education together for twenty years, and he
was my dear friend. Paltaa&rsquo;s force field collapsed when
he was escaping a fleet of Earth craft which were rising
into the sky in pursuit. At an acceleration of some
5,000 miles an hour, his craft collided with air in inertia,
and he and his &ldquo;saucer&rdquo; were vaporized in a blinding
flash and thunderous roar. The radio commentators
calmly informed the world that it was merely a large
meteor burning itself up in the atmosphere. (The stubborn
refusal of Earthmen to accept our existence continually
baffles me.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>From what I have heard these radio spokesmen say,
Earthmen who believe in us seem to regard us with a
sort of awe. They rightly consider us much farther advanced
than themselves, but you should hear the outlandish
descriptions some have given us. And after the
weird appearance they present to us, too!</p>
<p>I have judged the people of Earth to be excitable
and unpredictable. Therefore I can understand the
Federation&rsquo;s reluctance to have us make contact. Earthmen
undoubtedly regard us as invaders and would treat
us as such, although they must realize we have shown
no acts of aggression. Nevertheless, there have been a
few unfortunate instances that might tend to make
them think we are belligerent (namely, the Mantell
case in 1948). Kaal-taa-ar, pilot of the involved craft,
I understand, has been recalled to Ykaa because of his
mistake in permitting an Earth craft to venture into
his force field, thereby destroying the alien craft and
violating our strict orders to avoid any incidents with
Earth craft.</p>
<p>In spite of the obvious risk, it is my greatest anticipation
to meet these Earth folk face to face. Our observations
have been from afar and therefore lacking
much that we could really know about these people.
I&rsquo;m sure there are things they could teach us, and of
course there is much that we could do to make happier
their own existence. Some day, I know, the Federation
will give the word to land on Earth soil. Should I be
one of those fortunate ones, I am ready, and if it costs
me my life I shall be satisfied to have first enjoyed making
contact with other men who live so many light-years
from our own Ykaa.</p>
<p>When will this contact be, my friends?</p>
<p>Today?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Tomorrow?</p>
<p><i>When?</i></p>
<hr /><p class="tb">As he concluded his reading of the report, Mr.
Goodnight&rsquo;s eyes reflected the relief he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is reassuring, Doctor, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Dr. Lowenthal replied. &ldquo;Even with
my liberal translation, the nonaggressive attitude
comes through continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the final proof we needed as to the
authenticity of the saucers,&rdquo; Goodnight remarked.
&ldquo;This couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a hoax, could it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance. The substance of the original paper
is completely alien in its composition and manufacture,
and the language is undoubtedly the creation
of minds farther advanced than our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goodnight sighed as if a great burden had
been lifted from him. &ldquo;Well, our part in this is
closed, Dr. Lowenthal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is out of our
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; Lowenthal prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the job of others to determine if the manuscript
is to be made public. This thing could be
revolutionary in impact, Dr. Lowenthal. It could
change the thinking and living of every person on
Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The scientist nodded in agreement. &ldquo;You know,
Mr. Goodnight,&rdquo; he said after a meditative pause,
&ldquo;I believe that Kal-Pota-Tekkala would be a rather
nice fellow to know. I should really like to meet
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; Goodnight replied, then added significantly
with a sparkle of anticipation in his eyes,
&ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps some day, Doctor, not too
distant, we <i>shall</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c3"><br />RACE AROUND THE SUN</h2>
<p>Steve Gordon stared out of the forward
port of the <i>Condon Comet</i>, which was streaking toward
the sun. A dense filter protected his eyes from
the searing brilliance of the star, looming ever
larger by the day and hour as the rocket devoured
the miles at a speed never before equaled by a
space flyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll whip Dennis easily if we can keep up
this pace!&rdquo; exclaimed Steve&rsquo;s older brother, Bart,
in his clipped way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Steve saw a gloating, almost fanatical, expression
on Bart&rsquo;s face. Bart&rsquo;s one passion in life was to beat
a Dennis ship with a Condon craft. The rivalry
extended back eighteen years to 2003, when the
youths&rsquo; fathers had first started their competing
light-space-craft companies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look out back, Steve, and see if we&rsquo;re
still gaining,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>Steve left his seat and at the rear of the compartment
searched the TV screen, which showed the
star-filled darkness behind the ship. A small silvery
mote, the <i>Dennis Meteor</i>, moved against the immobile
stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re well ahead,&rdquo; Steve reported, turning
back. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let up, Bart? We&rsquo;ll burn out
our jets at this speed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart&rsquo;s expression was grimly set. &ldquo;This is the
moment Dad wished for all his life, Steve. A Condon
ship has always played second best to a Dennis.
Now that we seem to have broken through, do you
think I&rsquo;m going to let up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve realized that an eventual victory for Bart
would not settle anything, for then Jim Dennis
would strike back with an even better ship next
year, and the fight would continue. On and on it
would go until one of them took a foolhardy
chance. Then disaster would be the final victor in
the feud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going a hundred miles a second!&rdquo; Steve
protested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re already ahead of Jim&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s
record!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to set a record around the sun that
no Dennis ship will ever top!&rdquo; Bart asserted stubbornly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Steve had come along as Bart&rsquo;s assistant mainly
in the hope of somehow calming his brother&rsquo;s hotly
competitive spirit and restraining him from over-stepping
the bounds of common caution in this
race that held the interest of the entire world.</p>
<p>Steve looked over the strain dials on the control
panel. The needle was wavering toward the danger
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart, slow down!&rdquo; Steve burst out. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shake
ourselves to pieces! This refrigerator gauge has
been acting funny too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart checked the panel dials. &ldquo;I guess we can
afford to coast a little,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>They pushed levers, and Steve felt the little ship
bucking gently as her forward jets braked to slower
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you and Jim have to keep going on
like this year after year?&rdquo; Steve asked. &ldquo;A Dennis-Condon
merger would make for a terrific space
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart grinned tolerantly. &ldquo;Still trying, aren&rsquo;t you,
Steve?&rdquo; Then he frowned. &ldquo;If Jim Dennis wants
peace, let him come to us. Then we&rsquo;ll incorporate
his best points in our machines and call them Condons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to be a fifty-fifty proposition,
Bart,&rdquo; Steve reminded him. &ldquo;Jim has as much pride
as we do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The younger man studied the slowly enlarging
yolk of Sol in front of them. In spite of the heavy
filter over the port, it seemed as though the terrific
light and heat were burning through his eyes.</p>
<p>This was Steve&rsquo;s first trip, but he had been told
by Bart that the celestial furnace had an aura about
it that seemed to penetrate clear to one&rsquo;s bones.
Their refrigerating unit and heat-repulsing hull
would be taxed hard to keep them from bursting
into flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better check on Jim again,&rdquo; Bart said impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s holding back; I know he is. He won&rsquo;t try
to overtake us yet,&rdquo; Steve replied. Nevertheless,
he got up to take another look at the screen. He
was glad to see that his assumption was correct.</p>
<p>He returned to his seat at the panel and carefully
kept tab on the readings, covering first one
dial and then another. Some minutes later the refrigerator-gauge
needle unexpectedly soared above
the subzero mark. Almost at the same moment,
Steve felt encroaching heat pressing in on him from
all sides. The sweat popped out. The heat filled his
nostrils, burned his lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The refrigerator has broken down!&rdquo; Steve
gasped.</p>
<p>His gaze shifted to Bart, who was rubbing a
moist hand over his crimsoning face. Bart&rsquo;s fingers
jerked instinctively from the levers that had
quickly grown too hot to handle. In the motion,
Bart&rsquo;s arm carelessly brushed against one of the
side jet levers. The ship veered on its gyroscopic
balance and plunged out of control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Steve bumped against the far corner of the compartment,
feeling bruises all over him, but he was
not really hurt, although it seemed as though he
were breathing fire. Bart&rsquo;s head had struck the fire
drill, a big welding machine for repairing breaks
in the hull, stupefying him.</p>
<p>Steve shook his head to clear it and scrambled to
his seat, righting the ship again and putting it on
automatic pilot. Then he got up and hurried down
the corridor to the garb room. His magnetic shoes
clacked along the metal floor. Hurriedly, Steve
donned space suit, oxygen tank, and helmet.</p>
<p>The insulated gear momentarily cut out the oppressive
heat. But in another few minutes he and
Bart would be sizzling like steaks on a griddle, for
even the insulation of their suits could not withstand
raw heat for long. The only way out, as Steve
saw it, was to call on Jim Dennis.</p>
<p>Steve carried another set of gear down the corridor
and shook Bart. &ldquo;Put this on, Bart,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll protect you from the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart was gasping in the hot air of the compartment,
his face scarlet and shining, but he took the
gear. Next, Steve went outside onto the skin of the
<i>Condon Comet</i>. The vault of starlight closed in all
about him, and the deep web of midnight space
seemed to extend endlessly. There was the sweeping
veil of the Milky Way galaxy and here closer
the pulsing, blinding sphere of Sol. There was
another startling light, a driving streak of firestreams
and silvery glow&mdash;the <i>Dennis Meteor</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Jim and his co-pilot, Pete Rogers, could hardly
miss seeing them. Quickly the <i>Dennis Meteor</i> drew
abreast of the <i>Condon Comet</i>, but then it swept on
past overhead!</p>
<p>Steve felt bitterness and disappointment well up
in him. He had always thought Jim to be a &ldquo;right
guy.&rdquo; Could it be that the winning of the race was
more important to him than two persons&rsquo; lives?</p>
<p>The only hope now was a hasty repair of the
refrigerator unit. Steve hustled back into the ship
and made his way to the rear where the cooling
machinery was located. He found Bart working
there, his helmet off. Steve removed his own helmet,
for apparently Bart had repaired the trouble.
The customary blandness of the atmosphere had
been restored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to it?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dynamo burned out,&rdquo; Bart answered. &ldquo;I just
coupled in the spare one. Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out on the skin,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;I was trying to
signal Jim Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart&rsquo;s face went red again, and he muttered to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think there was any chance of repairing
the trouble,&rdquo; Steve went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather burn than take help from Jim Dennis!&rdquo;
Bart snapped. &ldquo;Did Dennis see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have. He went right overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously he didn&rsquo;t stop, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Steve said frankly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed that of Dennis,&rdquo; Bart
murmured. &ldquo;I thought he was a better man than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not have seen me, Bart. Let&rsquo;s give him
the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him nothing!&rdquo; Bart rapped. &ldquo;If Jim
Dennis wants a fight to the finish, we&rsquo;ll give it to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart began immediately to battle to regain their
lead. It was a frenzied, closely fought contest for
many hours, the lead seesawing back and forth. It
took the top speed Bart&rsquo;s craft was capable of to
gain the lead he was finally able to maintain.</p>
<p>Only when Jim Dennis appeared content to linger
behind again did Bart cut their driving velocity.
Once more Steve felt he could breathe easier&mdash;for
a while at least.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, there were no changes
in position. Steve and Bart took turns at the controls
during the sleeping periods. They could see
the planet Venus at a distance. Their flight had
been planned to avoid close proximity with Earth&rsquo;s
twin because of the retarding effect of her gravity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The sun steadily dominated the sky, an enormous
cottony ball of atomic fury with a surface
temperature of 6000 degrees centigrade and an interior
heat around 20,000,000 degrees. The red
leaping flames of the chromosphere were like the
mountainous waves of a gigantic cosmic ocean as
they lapped millions of miles out into surrounding
space. Magnetic storms&mdash;sunspots&mdash;all of them
large enough to swallow the Earth, were seen as
whirling dark cyclones in the sea of gas.</p>
<p>As the <i>Condon Comet</i> moved around and behind
the star, it began to close in on the planet
Mercury. The ship was actually overtaking the miniature
world even though it was circling the sun at
a rapid thirty miles a second.</p>
<p>On the fifth day away from Earth, the <i>Condon
Comet</i> reached its apogee, the farthest point of its
orbit from the mother planet. It was &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the
sun now, the dominant ball eclipsing the Earth. By
now Mercury had grown hugely, a big pebbly world
that literally shimmered with the frightening heat
that poured down upon it. It was a startling sight,
halved into hemispheres of darkness and extreme
brilliance. The closer side was so hot that streams
of molten tin and lead flowed, while that side away
from the sun approached the arctic cold of absolute
zero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t have to land there, Bart,&rdquo;
Steve spoke uncomfortably, looking out the port.</p>
<p>They began to feel the gravitational attraction
of the miniature world, and they had to bolster
rocket fire to combat it. Unlike Venus, Mercury
could not be avoided in this flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Steve watched the gauges, especially the refrigerator
dial. The latter was holding up well under this
maximum barrage of heat from Sol, but there was
still an oppressive hotness that reached through the
laboring artificial coolness and penetrated Steve&rsquo;s
pores like insidious rays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the <i>Comet</i> isn&rsquo;t superior to Dennis&rsquo;s in any
other way, it&rsquo;s made of better heat-resistant alloy,&rdquo;
Bart had said with self-assurance before leaving
Earth. Steve wondered now if the proof of this
assertion would be settled before both ships were
beyond the sun&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>Hours later, when the <i>Condon Comet</i> had passed
Mercury, Steve was impelled to check on their rivals
behind. For a moment he couldn&rsquo;t find the ship
on the TV screen. When he spotted it at last, by
changing the direction of the movable screen, he
was amazed to find the craft far below, hovering
over the planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; Steve called. &ldquo;It looks as if Jim and Pete
are in trouble! They&rsquo;re diving for Mercury and
seem to be heading for the terminator line between
the dark half and the light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve wished there were some kind of radio
communication between the ships, but electrical
interference from the sun made radio impossible
on these round-the-sun races.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go down there, Bart,&rdquo; Steve said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t won yet, Steve. There&rsquo;s still the record
to beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stop thinking about records!&rdquo; Steve
retorted. &ldquo;There are a couple of men down there in
trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they stop for us?&rdquo; Bart bit out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably
only a trick to lure us down so that Dennis can
make a quick getaway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Steve knew that his brother was not as cold-hearted
as he pretended to be. Bart proved it in
the next few minutes when he reluctantly turned
the <i>Comet&rsquo;s</i> nose downward with a savage thrust of
the upper tail jets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never regret this,&rdquo; Steve said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Bart grunted, without satisfaction.</p>
<p>As the ship moved strongly into Mercury&rsquo;s gravitation
field, Bart lined the automatic pilot up
with the tiny speck on the rocky world below that
was the <i>Dennis Meteor</i>. Then he and Steve
strapped down on their protective couches for the
grueling landing.</p>
<p>Steve felt as though his chest were crushed under
the rapid deceleration. It was the effect of a swiftly
dropping elevator multiplied hundreds of times as
the <i>Comet&rsquo;s</i> forward jets thrust against Mercury&rsquo;s
crust to brake the hurtling speed. Steve finally
blacked out; he always did. When he came to, they
had landed, and through blurry eyes Steve saw his
brother struggling to release himself from his
straps.</p>
<p>They went to the port. The <i>Dennis Meteor</i> was
in bad shape, its prow crumpled into a huge face of
rock. Its occupants could have been killed by the
concussion, although there was a good chance that
they were still alive if they had had time to strap
down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Steve noted their rugged surroundings, where
strange rock pillars thrust into the black sky from
a shimmering, white-hot plain. Snaky rifts of incalculable
depth split the torrid landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship landed on its side,&rdquo; Bart observed,
speaking over his short-range helmet radio. &ldquo;The
escape port is underneath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no point of exit from the ship for the
trapped occupants if they were still alive, Steve
observed. Even the rocket tubes had been crushed
flat. Actually the <i>Dennis Meteor</i> was a complete
ruin, its entire glossy surface warped and corrugated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see the ship broke down under the
heat,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they had to crash-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here on the other side!&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice
suddenly crackled in alarm over his helmet radio.</p>
<p>Bart joined him. Only now did they see that the
craft had nearly rolled down a precipitous incline
into a canyon stream of molten lead far below. The
ship was balanced precariously on the ledge. It
seemed as if the slightest jar would send it hurtling
down the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get them out of there before the
ship falls!&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;The precipice looks so
crumbly it may give way at any minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can get them out,&rdquo; Bart
commented.</p>
<p>Steve thought a moment. &ldquo;The fire drill! We can
cut a hole in the top of the ship!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Bart frowned. &ldquo;The force of the drill or even our
weight on top of it may cause the ship to go. But
if you&rsquo;re game, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They brought the fire drill out of the <i>Condon
Comet</i>, and as they climbed up onto the warped
hull of the other ship with it, Bart smiled wryly. &ldquo;I
never thought I&rsquo;d see the day that I&rsquo;d risk my neck
for a Dennis,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>A moment later, when Bart was about to start
the drill, he asked, &ldquo;Ever try swimming through
molten metal, Steve? You&rsquo;d better think about it.
We may be doing it in a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve felt weak in the knees as he looked down
into the plunging gulf where the metallic river
tossed against blackened rocks. A person flung into
that stream would be a cinder in scant moments.</p>
<p>Steve gritted his teeth. &ldquo;Start it up, Bart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The machine whined into action, pouring a thin
stream of blue-hot biting energy against the heat-resistant
alloy. The rocket shuddered under the
drill&rsquo;s action, and Steve felt waves of fear course
through him. The drill moved in an arc that was
to be a circle barely large enough for the two men
inside to squeeze through in their space suits.</p>
<p>When the job was halfway done, the ship ground
forward several feet. Steve saw Bart&rsquo;s face drain
whitely. Steve could almost feel the scorching bite
of liquid metal against his body. Yet the ship somehow
clung stubbornly to its precarious support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>They renewed their efforts, and the arc grew. Finally
the circle was full round. Bart stood up and
jammed a foot against the isolated ring, and it
dropped inside. Steve held his breath as he looked
in, afraid of what he might see. He felt immeasurable
relief as Jim and Pete came up to the opening
attired in space gear. They shoved a ladder into
place and started up. Steve gave Pete a hand, for
he seemed to be shaken up. Suddenly the ship rumbled
a foot or two. It was going any instant. The
four of them carefully walked the length of the
craft and made their way down the flattened rocket
tubes.</p>
<p>Bart was the last to jump to the ground. His
movement affected the delicate balance of the ship,
and it slid forward, its stern arching straight up as
it dipped over the gulf. The ground shook, and a
moment later the <i>Dennis Meteor</i> had thundered to
oblivion into the river of lead.</p>
<p>After Jim and Pete had expressed gratitude for
their rescue, the four fell into silence as they
trooped back to the <i>Condon Comet</i>. Although no
one spoke, Steve felt that the others, like himself,
must be thinking many things. Would this mark
the end of the long feud, or would it be only a temporary
truce?</p>
<p>Jim Dennis walking with a limp, studied the
Condon ship. He circled the rocket completely and
closely examined the smooth hull, still undamaged
by the abnormal heat bombardment it was taking.</p>
<p>When they were inside, Jim was the first to
speak. &ldquo;This ship is terrific,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit that?&rdquo; Bart asked incredulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a craft stand up so perfectly under
extreme heat,&rdquo; Jim continued. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve
done it, Bart. It&rsquo;s the finest light space ship ever
built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An engineer who started out with Dad made
this alloy,&rdquo; Bart declared. &ldquo;He told me he thought
he had finally come up with the ideal metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Meteor</i> rattled like an old freighter the
whole way!&rdquo; Jim complained. &ldquo;We spent a lot of
time in the rear checking on the rocket tubes. We
were afraid they&rsquo;d shake loose. I guess we must
have been back there when we passed you, for the
last time I looked out you were ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That explained why they hadn&rsquo;t seen his wave,
Steve thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was a lucky break for us that you
brought your drill along,&rdquo; Jim went on. &ldquo;I had so
much confidence in the <i>Meteor</i> I was sure we
wouldn&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt the same way,&rdquo; Bart admitted, &ldquo;but Steve
insisted we bring it. That kid brother of mine
always did have more practical sense than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thinking since we crash-landed,
Bart,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking that
maybe this feud has gone on long enough and that
you must be as sick of it as I am. Together, we could
turn out ships that would be just about perfect.
What do you say, Bart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart&rsquo;s face grew stern and thoughtful. Finally he
answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think it over first, Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re thinking, we may as well have a
look-see,&rdquo; Jim said. He went over to the panel
and checked the readings. &ldquo;You seem to be way
ahead of my old record, Bart. You&rsquo;re still going to
try to beat it, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve knew this remark had broken down the
last of Bart&rsquo;s stubborn pride and reserve. His
brother smiled and thrust out his hand to Jim Dennis.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good loser, Jim,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no loser,&rdquo; Jim answered, grinning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
winner&mdash;we both are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Steve Condon sighed contentedly. He
glanced at Pete Rogers, who winked at him. Jim
and Bart sat down side by side at the control panel
of the <i>Condon Comet</i>. Steve didn&rsquo;t doubt for a moment
that the long feud was finally at an end. He
was satisfied that his father would have liked it this
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c4"><br />FLIGHT OF THE CENTAURUS</h2>
<p>Spacemaster Brigger came into the navigation
compartment of the <i>Centaurus</i>, which was
thrusting into the starry night of space far beyond
Saturn. Rob Allison, junior officer, looked up from
the desk where he sat, wondering at the frown on
the skipper&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I feared, Allison,&rdquo; Mr. Brigger said
gravely. &ldquo;The men are sorry they signed on for
Titania and are grumbling already. They think
they&rsquo;ll be ridiculed when they get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of Dr. Franz&rsquo;s being discredited by all
the scientists, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper nodded. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re on
a wild-goose chase. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m inclined to agree
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you and the crew, sir, are only reflecting
the opinion of almost everyone else on Earth,&rdquo; Rob
mused bitterly.</p>
<p>The spacemaster of the <i>Centaurus</i> dropped onto
a plastic bench beside a port that overlooked the
star fields of the outer solar system. &ldquo;Exactly why
did your brother Grant authorize this expedition,
Allison? Does he really believe we&rsquo;ll find animal
life on Uranus&rsquo; satellite or is it something else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grant Allison, an illustrious front-rank explorer
of several years before, was now president of Interplanet
Exploration, which controlled research
space travel.</p>
<p>Rob relaxed as he prepared to answer. &ldquo;You
probably didn&rsquo;t know, sir, that Dr. Franz put my
brother through space school when our father
couldn&rsquo;t afford it. He was Grant&rsquo;s teacher in space
mechanics in high school and thought he showed
unusual promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would explain President Allison&rsquo;s interest
in Dr. Franz,&rdquo; Mr. Brigger agreed, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t understand
an intelligent man like your brother falling
for a harebrained story such as Dr. Franz told.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The facts of Dr. Franz&rsquo;s amazing discovery were
known to the whole world. While studying the
planet Uranus a distance of two and a half years
before, the research ship blew a rocket tube and
was forced down on Titania, Uranus&rsquo; largest moon.
While the crewmen repaired the craft, Dr. Franz
went prospecting. After he returned, he reported
that he saw fish life swimming beneath Titania&rsquo;s
solid ice sheet, where the temperature was 300
degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The crewmen were
too interested in their work and, not having a scientific
curiosity anyhow, did not bother to verify
the scientist&rsquo;s claim.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Earth, Dr. Franz, who was in
the early stage of a fatal illness, told the scientific
world of his remarkable discovery. He was totally
unprepared for the rebuff he received from all
quarters. No scientist on Earth would admit that
Dr. Franz&rsquo;s preposterous tale could possibly be
true. Those people who would not go as far as calling
Dr. Franz a dishonest publicity seeker (as some
did) were nevertheless agreed that the ordeal he
had gone through must have been too much for
him. Dr. Franz died six months later of his illness&mdash;a
brokenhearted man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant truly believed Dr. Franz found life on
Titania,&rdquo; Rob said to the skipper of the <i>Centaurus</i>.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so sure of it that he has risked his own career
on this expedition. If this fails, he says public sentiment
will force him out of office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother must have a lot of confidence in
you, Allison,&rdquo; Mr. Brigger said, &ldquo;making you head
of this research trip which is so important to him.
But from what I hear of your exploits on other
planets, he has reason to trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Rob murmured. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do a
good job, though, if I didn&rsquo;t believe as whole-heartedly
in this as Grant does. I believe, as Grant
does, that Dr. Franz spoke the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will certainly be a revolutionary discovery
for science if you find and bring back evidence of
that,&rdquo; the skipper admitted.</p>
<p>Before leaving the compartment, Mr. Brigger
added, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope we don&rsquo;t have a mutiny on our
hands before this thing is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone, Rob got up and stared out of the port
into the perpetual black deeps where the star
points glowed like polished gems.</p>
<p>Some minutes later a young spaceman with
sandy, disordered hair that even space regulations
could do nothing with, came into the compartment.
Jim Hawley was Rob&rsquo;s best friend and had flighted
a number of expeditions with him. There was a
sober look on Jim&rsquo;s customarily jovial face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men are complaining like babies, Rob,&rdquo;
Jim said. &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll be any good to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to be, Jim,&rdquo; Rob answered grimly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked at his stalwart young friend in admiration.
&ldquo;You and Grant are all right, Rob. Not
many men would risk their careers on an old man&rsquo;s
whims. Aren&rsquo;t you scared&mdash;just a little bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m plenty scared,&rdquo; Rob told him, with a nervous
smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a subofficer of five months,
and here I am in charge of an expedition. Don&rsquo;t
think that isn&rsquo;t frightening. In a sense, the lives of
all men aboard the ship will be in my hands after
we land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you need me,&rdquo; Jim assured him, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s one
buddy you can count on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Two days later the Centaurus had intercepted
the orbit of Titania and was beginning to barrel
surfaceward. Rob, looking outside from the officer&rsquo;s
platform up forward, saw a huge rocky world filling
the port, its mantle of ice shimmering in the reflected
light of the unseen primary body.</p>
<p>The <i>Centaurus</i> dropped lower over a plateau that
Rob had pointed out to Mr. Brigger as the spot
where Dr. Franz had visited. The underjets threw
out pencils of braking power to check the plunge
of the space ship.</p>
<p>Finally the <i>Centaurus</i> touched down on its tail
fins and then Spacemaster Brigger said to Rob, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all yours now, Allison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out over the hoary wilderness, completely
airless because of the little world&rsquo;s inability
to retain an atmosphere, Rob felt suddenly incompetent.
Only now did he realize fully his youthful
inexperience. It was one thing to be an idle witness
on a journey; it was another to be in charge of a
crew of men.</p>
<p>Rob heard footsteps on the platform and turned
to see Jim Hawley walking up. Jim grinned in his
engaging fashion, and it was like a tonic to Rob&rsquo;s
spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we get started, Rob?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob had the skipper round up the crew in the
orientation compartment as soon as he had made
his own plans. Then he laid before them the order
of procedure. On a flannel board he tacked an enlarged
map he had copied from one owned by Dr. Franz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a sketch of this area,&rdquo; Rob explained.
&ldquo;Dr. Franz neglected to mark where he had seen
the fishlike animal swimming beneath the ice. He
did report that he was only able to find one after
days of searching. They must be very scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So scarce there probably aren&rsquo;t any at all,&rdquo; retorted
one of the subofficers in a low voice.</p>
<p>Rob ignored the remark and went on with his
explanation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scatter out over the area and
begin searching. It won&rsquo;t be an easy job because
the ice isn&rsquo;t completely clear but is streaked
through with ammonia and other opaque solubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how long will we have to keep up this
search?&rdquo; another crewman demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to spend Christmas in this forsaken place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spacemaster Brigger spoke up then. &ldquo;We can
spend seven days on searching and still have
enough supplies and fuel to get us home again. If
we don&rsquo;t find anything in that time, we start back
just the same. Is that clear, Mr. Allison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Rob said. Seven days sounded like
ample time, but the area they had to cover was
several square miles. From Dr. Franz&rsquo;s description
of the place, the liquid medium beneath the ice
was wide and deep, a veritable ocean. Beneath this
solution the ice began again and extended into the
core of the small planet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Explanations over, the majority of the crew,
about twenty spacemen, climbed into their space
gear, Rob and Jim with them. Mr. Brigger and a
few key personnel would remain aboard to attend
the operational facilities of the ship. The suits were
triple-reinforced against the exceeding cold and
were electrically heated. The helmets, with inside
radio sets, were frost-free types, and the shoes were
doubly weighted and spike-soled for navigating
over the icy, low-gravity surface.</p>
<p>The men descended to the ground on an escalator
dropped from the side of the <i>Centaurus</i>. Rob had
the men spread out, two by two, as safety buddies.
He concentrated on the farther corners of the ice
field to begin with, intending to bring the searchers
closer and closer to the ship each day.</p>
<p>As the men began hiking over the glacier, Rob
and Jim talked together through their helmet radio
sets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the water under the ice
flows without freezing in this superlow temperature,&rdquo;
Jim remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be water,&rdquo; Rob answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something
else, probably a liquefied gas with an extremely
low freezing point. Wherever it is, it must
contain all the elements needed to support its
strange life forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start looking too, Jim,&rdquo; Rob suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The first &ldquo;day&rdquo; passed without success. Then the
second. Night was only a relative term, for Uranus,
Titania&rsquo;s main source of light, was never out of the
sky. On the third day, some of the men complained
about having to spend ten hours at a time in biting
cold weather searching for something they were
sure did not even exist. Despite the men&rsquo;s heavily
insulated suits, the ultralow temperature that
frosted the suits like mold could not be entirely
kept out. Rob sympathized with the men, but
there was no other way to do the job.</p>
<p>It was on the fifth day that one of the searchers
spotted a small thick-bodied shape several feet beneath
the ice. The cordon of searchers had closed
in more than halfway to the ship by now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, will you supervise operation of the ice
saw?&rdquo; Rob asked, when they had joined the men
who had made the discovery.</p>
<p>Jim nodded and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it moved yet?&rdquo; Rob asked one of the crewmen,
trying to curb the almost overpowering excitement
he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; one of them replied. &ldquo;It seems to be dead
and embedded in the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the ice saw came trundling up on its
ski runners, being pushed along by Jim and two
others. It was a boxlike machine, heavily insulated
against the cold. Jim dropped the blade and turned
on the machine, guiding it along an invisible outline
around the imprisoned thing. He went over
the cuts several times, lowering the blade each time
until a depth of several feet was reached. Then he
gave the saw a side-to-side motion, and there was a
sharp crack as the block of ice was snapped off beneath
the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>By now all the searchers had come over. Jim
worked the lifters on the machine and the block
of ice, containing its inanimate prisoner, was raised
and set down. The men crowded close and looked.
Then Rob looked, and Jim. Rob felt a sickening
disappointment as he realized their failure. There
was no creature inside the ice at all. It was nothing
but a slab of rock.</p>
<p>One of the men snorted contemptuously. Another
laughed openly in scorn.</p>
<p>Rob bit his lips and regretfully ordered the ice
saw back to the ship. Then he sent the men back
to their positions of search.</p>
<p>The young officer felt little hope. The ring was
closing in toward the <i>Centaurus</i>. There wasn&rsquo;t
much more area that hadn&rsquo;t already been examined.
Rob, realizing the attitude of the men, knew
they hadn&rsquo;t probed as diligently as they were supposed
to have. Very likely large areas had been
only carelessly examined. But that couldn&rsquo;t be
helped.</p>
<p>Rob went through the last day with the slow
resignation of defeat settling within him. In only
a few hours the searchers would have covered the
entire area, and their own moment of victory would
be at hand.</p>
<p>When the search was finally over and still no
one had found anything moving beneath the ice,
Rob knew how it felt to taste defeat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Jim clapped Rob sympathetically on the shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rob,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps later on
there will be another expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any more to this place, you can
be sure of that!&rdquo; Rob blurted. &ldquo;After this failure,
the Space Command certainly won&rsquo;t send any more
good money after bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, as all on board the <i>Centaurus</i> slept, Rob
tossed restlessly on his cot. He heard the quiet
breathing of the crewmen in the adjoining compartments.
They were happy; their reluctant job
was done and they were going home. The blast-off
was scheduled for 0600 the next morning.</p>
<p>Rob could not stand his plaguing thoughts. He
got out of bed and pulled on his clothes. He looked
across the room at Jim Hawley, breathing deeply
in sound slumber. Rob walked down the corridor
to the garb room and began tugging on space gear.
He realized only then how bone-weary he was, how
his head ached from the tension of the past weeks,
how heavily his heart throbbed in his breast. He
couldn&rsquo;t relax any place now, he knew, but it would
be easier outside, continuing the search to the very
end.</p>
<p>Rob tucked an electron gun in the holster of his
suit, then left the <i>Centaurus</i>. He struck out over
the glacier pack, his head lowered. It came to him
then how difficult it would have been for the men
to detect any moving object in the murky maze
below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Hours passed and Rob found himself far from
the ship. He was shivering from the stubborn cold.
He turned the heat in his suit to full strength
and pushed his aching legs faster to speed up the
circulation. His eyes never left the ground, searching,
searching....</p>
<p>If he were the only one involved in the failure,
it wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much, but it was his brother&rsquo;s
problem too. Grant hadn&rsquo;t made many mistakes
on research expeditions&mdash;that was why he
held the highest office in the organization. After
this, though, it would go hard with him. Then there
was the misunderstood Dr. Franz, who deserved a
better fate than being labeled an old man who in
his final days seemed to have lost his clear, scientific
outlook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, though, the public was right,&rdquo; Rob
thought. &ldquo;Maybe it was a hoax Dr. Franz pulled
in order to gain public recognition he had never
quite made.&rdquo; But even now, in the blackest moment,
Rob couldn&rsquo;t really believe this of the dear
friend who had launched his brother&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s legs were beginning to feel like stumps
as the time dragged on. He stumbled often on burls
of ice that cluttered the wasteland. Finally he
tripped and fell heavily, and it seemed that he did
not even have the strength to rise again. His helmet
was flat on the ice and his eyes, misted over
with sleeplessness, were still looking downward.</p>
<p><i>Then he caught a sign of movement in the
depths.</i> He blinked his eyes to clear the glaze out
of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no hallucination
either!&rdquo; It was a long dark shape threading
its way sluggishly down below. Now the thing
was rising to the surface. Cold, bulging eyes
peered into his own.</p>
<p>With numb fingers Rob uncached his electron
gun and pressed the barrel against the ice. A moment
later the creature was hanging buoyant and
lifeless under the submerged edge of the ice layer.
Rob struggled to his feet, astounded at the renewed
energy he now had. He memorized the spot
as best his dazed faculties would allow. Then he
laid the pistol on the ice for an additional marker.
He began running toward the ship.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Rob&rsquo;s mind seemed to
be in a dream world. He vaguely remembered the
long way back to the space ship and then nearly
collapsing before reaching it. He dimly remembered
Jim, who had missed him, coming outside
and assisting him into the warmth of the vessel.
And he barely recalled pouring out the story of
his find.</p>
<p>Now, much later, he was fully awake and the
nightmare was over. He found himself on his cot,
fully dressed. Jim Hawley was looking down on
him. Rob was aware that the ship was moving. He
knew the <i>Centaurus</i> had already blasted off for
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find&mdash;!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jim soothed him with a smile. &ldquo;Yeah, we dug
out your monster and we&rsquo;ve got him aboard. If
you&rsquo;re through being a sleepyhead, I&rsquo;ll take you to
see him.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long have I been under?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel rested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good as new,&rdquo; Rob answered.</p>
<p>They went down the corridor to one of the cold-storage
compartments. Several of the crew were inside,
as well as the skipper. But Rob wasn&rsquo;t noticing
the men. He was looking at a dark alien form
lying on the floor. Rob went over closer and knelt
down. The creature was fishlike, and the strangest
thing about it was the glistening dark skin, similar
to metal. Rob touched it and it was like stroking
cold steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder it can live in such frigid temperatures,&rdquo;
Rob murmured, &ldquo;with a metallic covering
like that! Won&rsquo;t the scientists back home have a
picnic dissecting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up and found his gaze level with Mr.
Brigger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never believed in your fantastic theory,&rdquo; the
chief officer said, &ldquo;and I still doubt it after I&rsquo;ve
seen it. But I admired your spirit from the first,
Allison. I believe you would have been as good a
loser as a winner and I&rsquo;m proud to have flighted
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>He smiled and offered his hand to Rob, who
shook it. Then the others came forward, and they
too offered congratulations. But Rob&rsquo;s thoughts
weren&rsquo;t for his own success this day. They were
reaching ahead to when Grant Allison would be
even more of a fabulous figure in the field of space
science, and Dr. Franz would at last have claimed
his well-deserved victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c5"><br />EXPEDITION PLUTO</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The lieutenant doesn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve got
your mind on navigation, Rob,&rdquo; Duff Ford was saying,
as he and Rob Allison stood before a port of
the rocket ship <i>Rigel</i> looking out over the sea of
space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it show that much?&rdquo; the lean young spaceman
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him, Rob,&rdquo; the redhead answered.
&ldquo;Stop eating your heart out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never knew Jim Hawley, did you, Duff?&rdquo;
Rob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but from what I&rsquo;ve heard of him, he&rsquo;s
quite a guy. Always smiling and bursting with
friendliness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jim,&rdquo; Rob said, a tightness in his throat.
&ldquo;I sure would like to know what happened to him
and the others on Pluto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you didn&rsquo;t get to go along on the
first Pluto expedition?&rdquo; Duff asked. &ldquo;I thought you
and Jim Hawley always went together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working with my brother in the
States,&rdquo; Rob replied. &ldquo;As the new president of
Interplanet Exploration, he&rsquo;s been awfully busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real guy,&rdquo; Duff said with admiration,
&ldquo;your brother Grant. I guess he&rsquo;s the greatest spaceman
who&rsquo;s been born. And judging by your own
record around the solar system, Rob, you&rsquo;re not far
behind him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the flattery,&rdquo; Rob said, grinning.</p>
<p>It felt good to smile again. He hadn&rsquo;t smiled
since he&rsquo;d learned about the break in communication
from the Pluto expedition ship <i>Capella</i>. The
breakoff had come suddenly after landing, and the
source of the trouble was unknown. As soon as Rob
had heard that the <i>Rigel</i> was going in search of
the missing explorers, he had signed up for the
trip as assistant to the navigator. He&rsquo;d been grateful
for the companionship of young Duff Ford, a
likeable fellow he&rsquo;d met in space school. Duff was
a regular crewman, an air purifier, on the <i>Rigel</i>.</p>
<p>Duff was speaking again. &ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll get by the
big boy there with the halo?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Rob looked at the giant, glowing pearl of Saturn,
which had been growing before their eyes for the
past couple of days. Though placid and beautiful
against the velvet sky, the ringed planet was a real
menace to the <i>Rigel</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Stone said it&rsquo;s going to be a tight
squeeze,&rdquo; Rob answered. &ldquo;We hope we&rsquo;ve got
enough rocket power to fight off the terrific gravity
pull of Saturn and his moons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why we couldn&rsquo;t go on a
beeline to Pluto without even coming close to the
other planets,&rdquo; Duff said. &ldquo;Pluto is a long ways off
the plane of the outer planets, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; Rob answered, &ldquo;if it weren&rsquo;t for
floating clouds of explosive hydrogen which have
been found to exist outside of the plane of the
ecliptic. That&rsquo;s why we have to stay in close until
we&rsquo;re past Neptune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Uranus and Neptune give us trouble?&rdquo;
Duff asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty big too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uranus is far around on his orbit, and Neptune
is heading away from us. However, we&rsquo;ll see Neptune
at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later Rob was in the navigation compartment
with Lieutenant Stone, his immediate superior.
They were leaning over a level ground-glass
screen upon which were a projected television image
and a panel of dials. In the middle of the scene
was poised the oblate sphere of Saturn and its spinning
necklace of millions of meteoric particles.
Scattered about were globes of varying sizes, which
were Saturn&rsquo;s moons. The screen surface was roughened
to take pencil marks. A tiny dot represented
the <i>Rigel</i>, and arcs were drawn to show the motions
of all the objects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our closest approach to the planet will be here
at point &lsquo;X&rsquo;,&rdquo; spoke the navigator. Glancing at his
watch, he added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got about five minutes to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they waited, Rob went over to the side port
where he could watch the luminous planet directly.
He thought he had never seen a sight so
beautiful. Saturn was banded with color layers
something in the manner of Jupiter, only in softer
tints. Riotous masses seethed and tossed in the cauldron
of fury beneath the apparently paper-thin
girdle of shaded bands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gorgeous&mdash;but deadly too,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Stone commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Rob murmured, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m in no mood
for a bath of methane and ammonia. We&rsquo;ve got to
get to Pluto; that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s important!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At zero hour, all rockets were blowing at full
capacity. Rob could feel the <i>Rigel</i> bending to the
implacable will of the big world. As the ship&rsquo;s nose
was pulled inward, the young spaceman could see
the anxiety on his superior&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ve calculated this thing correctly,
Rob,&rdquo; the lieutenant said tightly. &ldquo;The ship
should begin to turn tail on Saturn in a little
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the <i>Rigel</i> still had not turned after twenty,
nor even forty, minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re losing ground!&rdquo; Lieutenant Stone said,
checking a dial on the screen. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!
But that can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob went over to the screen, where the spectroscope
dial showed that the globe was growing
closer, although it was not visibly so. If the <i>Rigel</i>
were not checked within a short time, the space
ship would plunge into Saturn&rsquo;s poisonous atmosphere!
Rob picked up a clipboard of papers and
began studying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything if we were on the <i>Procyon</i>
which took you and your brother to Jupiter!&rdquo; Lieutenant
Stone complained. &ldquo;The <i>Rigel</i>&rsquo;s built primarily
for distance and hasn&rsquo;t a fraction of the <i>Procyon</i>&rsquo;s
rocket thrust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be something wrong in the figures
for Titan!&rdquo; Rob suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Stone looked over his shoulder. Silently
the two went through the figures, inspecting
every equation where the numbers appeared relating
to Saturn&rsquo;s largest satellite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The figures are wrong in two places!&rdquo; the officer
exclaimed. &ldquo;No wonder we miscalculated the total
gravity pull! Whoever prepared these notes back
at the base will surely catch it! I guess we can&rsquo;t
blame him too much, though. These figures were
worked up on extra short notice for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re we going to do, lieutenant?&rdquo; Rob
asked. &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s on top power drive now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Lieutenant Stone explained the new development
over the intercom phone to Spacemaster
O&rsquo;Leary. The skipper verified the fact that the
<i>Rigel</i> was on full thrust. He said that there was
no other alternative but to abandon ship and make
for the moon Japetus in the two space boats and
hope to be picked up later from there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t abandon the ship!&rdquo; Rob burst out
uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, Allison?&rdquo; came the skipper&rsquo;s retort
over the intercom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but I was thinking of the
<i>Capella</i> and her crew!&rdquo; Rob said. &ldquo;What will happen
to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be helped I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the skipper
replied. &ldquo;My first duty is to my ship and men. Both
of you prepare to abandon ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Spacemaster O&rsquo;Leary had cut off, Lieutenant
Stone said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rob. I know how much
you thought of Spaceman Hawley, but there&rsquo;s nothing
more to be done. Better get together what stuff
you want to take along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as the officer began getting up his
things, Rob remained at the screen, poring over it
and a little mathematical machine called an electronic
computer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to go, Rob?&rdquo; Lieutenant Stone asked
sometime later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found something, sir!&rdquo; Rob said,
holding a place on the screen with his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A die-hard, if I ever saw one,&rdquo; murmured his
superior, with an admiring grin. He came over to
see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scylla is known to have a slightly unpredictable
orbit,&rdquo; Rob said. &ldquo;During the past few minutes
I&rsquo;ve traced it cutting inward toward the planet. I&rsquo;ve
checked the moon&rsquo;s gravity-and-distance ratio on
the computer, and I believe if we delay the abandon-ship
for several more minutes we can pull free
of Saturn and its family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; the lieutenant said. They checked
the slight movement of Saturn&rsquo;s tenth satellite,
which had been discovered in 1963. Scylla was
tiny, a dense ball of rock only three miles in diameter.
But its diminishing gravity pull as it moved
away could be enough to swing the balance in favor
of the <i>Rigel</i>.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Stone agreed with Rob&rsquo;s finding in
general, although in the brief time available there
was no opportunity to make a positive measurement.
He phoned the skipper, who was ready to
send out the first space boat. Lieutenant Stone reported
to him Rob&rsquo;s find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you agree it&rsquo;s worth a chance, lieutenant, I&rsquo;ll
play ball,&rdquo; the skipper replied.</p>
<p>As Rob stared apprehensively at the big planet
from the side port, he tormented himself about
whether he had done the right thing in suggesting
what he did. Had the <i>Rigel</i> been abandoned, as
was planned, all hands would have been saved. As
things stood now, however, the entire crew might
perish. Still, Rob could not really regret taking the
responsibility. Times before, when there had been
lives at stake, he had stuck by his convictions and
had never failed to accept danger when that seemed
the best move for all concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Rob and Lieutenant Stone kept their eyes glued
on the TV screen, particularly the speck that was
Scylla and the slight motion it was describing. Rob
felt shudders rock the space ship as great powers
locked in combat.</p>
<p>Some minutes later, Lieutenant Stone checked
the dials and said with a deep sigh of relief, &ldquo;I
think we&rsquo;ve done it! Thanks, Rob!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had done it. The balance was swung in favor
of the <i>Rigel</i> as Saturn&rsquo;s tiny companion continued
to move away, giving up the fight. From now on the
planet would appear to diminish in size, but it
would be many hours before its commanding
sphere would be lost among the other millions of
lights in the heavens.</p>
<p>For days and days, nothing seemed to change in
the endless depths of black space as the <i>Rigel</i> sped
toward Pluto. There were the same monotonous
patterns of stardust and the eternally broad sweep
of the Milky Way and other remote galaxies. Only
the distant planets grew and shrank in size. As the
space ship neared Neptune, the big green world
enlarged importantly. Rob and Duff, in an off-duty
hour, watched the frigid, lonely planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neptune reminds me a little of Earth,&rdquo; Rob
said.</p>
<p>Duff&rsquo;s brows raised questioningly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
<i>any</i> similarity. Why, Neptune is four times Earth&rsquo;s
diameter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Neptune&rsquo;s mean surface gravity is the same
as Earth&rsquo;s because of its low density,&rdquo; Rob replied.
&ldquo;Like Saturn, another big puffball, Neptune has a
small rocky core surrounded by huge layers of ice
and atmosphere. Both Neptune and Earth have a
greenish cast, and each has a satellite of about the
same size and at about the same distance away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one big difference, though, Rob,&rdquo; Duff
said. &ldquo;Neptune&rsquo;s a zillion times colder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still not as cold as we&rsquo;re going to find
Pluto,&rdquo; Rob reminded him, &ldquo;near absolute zero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The redhead made a wry face. &ldquo;Why did you
have to say that? It&rsquo;s so warm and comfortable in
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the <i>Rigel</i> drove onward, thousands of miles
a minute, day upon day, Rob grew impatient to
reach Pluto. He was thinking of Jim Hawley and
the <i>Capella</i> crew undergoing unknown hardship
and peril. The radio circuit with the ill-fated space
ship had been left open in case she was able to get
a message through. But none had come during all
this time, and Rob was beginning to doubt that he
would ever see his fun-loving friend again.</p>
<p>The day finally came when the <i>Rigel</i> hovered
over the little planet, which was not quite as large
a world as Mars. Rob and Duff, with some of the
other crewmen in the pilots&rsquo; compartment, stared
down upon trackless wastes of incredible frozen
beauty. Ever since the ship had dropped low
enough to reveal the dazzling surface features of
the solar system&rsquo;s most distant planet, no one had
spoken. The bizarre landscape seemed to have awed
everyone into a state of silent fascination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Suddenly Duff broke the quiet. &ldquo;Look, what a
pretty blue lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob saw the small body of water partly surrounded
by a canyon of towering ice cliffs. In the
twilight glow of stars and the weak sun, the lake
and peaks sparkled with a clarity that reminded
Rob of great jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lake rightly enough,&rdquo; Spacemaster
O&rsquo;Leary said. &ldquo;You can see the ripples, but that&rsquo;s
no water.&rdquo; He checked the thermocouple. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
348 degrees below zero Fahrenheit down there!
That&rsquo;s a lake of <i>liquid oxygen</i>. I&rsquo;ve seen them on
the dark side of Mercury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob gasped in astonishment. He had visited
most of the planets, but there was nothing to compare
with a wonder such as this.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Stone then spoke. &ldquo;Those ice cliffs
don&rsquo;t look to be frozen water. Do you think they
might be chunks of dry ice, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; the spacemaster replied,
&ldquo;&mdash;solid carbon dioxide. Notice those other crystal
peaks off to the right. They are probably ammonia.
I&rsquo;ve seen them on Mercury, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>There was a scant, dense atmosphere close to the
ground&mdash;that had been known. It was a strange-looking
substance, Rob thought. It lay like a blanket
of gray-blue mist between the space ship, which
was several thousands of feet up, and the ground
below. The compressed atmosphere was filled with
small clouds of icelike particles which floated lazily
near the surface like tiny fish in a cosmic ocean.
Everything about the scene suggested a terrible
coldness almost beyond human realization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our bearings indicate this is approximately the
area where the <i>Capella</i> was last heard from,&rdquo; the
skipper declared. &ldquo;But I see nothing of the ship.
Do any of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the others, Rob strained his eyes to pick
out a shiny cigar shape in the bleak stretches below.
It seemed an impossible task, and he was
reminded of an old analogy of the elusive needle
in the haystack. There were broad areas of dark
rock between the icebergs, filmed over lightly with
rime. Such dark expanses could account for Pluto&rsquo;s
weak solar reflection, Rob decided.</p>
<p>The <i>Rigel</i> cut its power to a low cruising speed
and began making a detailed search. Scanning
scopes were used to magnify the view, but the job
promised to be a long and painstaking one.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would even take too long to be of any
service to the <i>Capella</i>, Rob thought gloomily, as
his scope swept the ground. His speculations then
took an even grimmer turn. Perhaps the lake of oxygen
had swallowed up the space ship! Or maybe
the craft lay buried under layers of frost.</p>
<p>The hours of search, many of them, dragged by.
At last the skipper called his crewmen together and
make a pronouncement that shocked Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no purpose in keeping up the search
any longer,&rdquo; he said decisively. &ldquo;Even if we should
find the ship now, we don&rsquo;t have enough fuel to
land and blast off again. I&rsquo;m afraid the elements
have claimed the <i>Capella</i> and that the first expedition
to Pluto will have to be written off the books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,...!&rdquo; Rob burst out.</p>
<p>The spacemaster looked at him levelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rob. I realize you&rsquo;ve got a more personal
interest in the <i>Capella</i> than the rest of us.
But we&rsquo;re simply licked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob turned away from him in abject despair and
stared unseeingly out of the port. Filling his inner
eye, to the oblivion of all else, was the sight of a
grinning young spaceman, with a perpetually rumpled
shock of blond hair. <i>He&rsquo;d never see Jim Hawley
again.</i> Knowing this, it was as though a part of
himself had suddenly died.</p>
<p>As the Rigel headed away from the area over
which it had cruised unsuccessfully for so long a
time, a burst of static came over the long-silent,
open circuit of the space ship&rsquo;s radio. Rob&rsquo;s heart
thrilled with hope. Could it really be the <i>Capella</i>
trying to make contact?</p>
<p>More static followed, then a muffled voice,
barely audible, saying: &ldquo;<i>Capella</i> to space ship. Can
you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spacemaster O&rsquo;Leary scooped up the radio mike,
eager as a child. &ldquo;Yes! Yes! Give your location!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The communication came over badly, but
O&rsquo;Leary found out that he was speaking to the <i>Capella</i>&rsquo;s
skipper, Spacemaster Nielson. Port telescopes
were pointed to the spot given as the location
of the downed rocket. Rob focused his on the
upright craft, which was buried in hoarfrost and
situated on the top of a slope leading down into the
blue oxygen lake. Rob realized that only the luckiest
of glances could have picked up the camouflaged
ship.</p>
<p>On the mike again, Spacemaster O&rsquo;Leary asked,
&ldquo;Are all aboard the ship well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all suffering from the cold,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Remember we&rsquo;ve been here for weeks, although
it seems like years! We had to draw from
the atomic reactor to make a heater, but that isn&rsquo;t
adequate. Some of the men have frostbite. The ship
is under a foot of frozen matter as you can see. The
truth of the matter is we came woefully unprepared
to tackle such an icebox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get marooned?&rdquo; asked O&rsquo;Leary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we landed, the frost began piling
up,&rdquo; Nielson replied. &ldquo;It clogged our jets and our
aerial, which is the reason we lost contact with
Earth. The hull defrosters were a complete failure.
We just now got the antenna partially repaired
after all these weeks. One of the crewmen, Jim
Hawley, had to work outside on it. He&rsquo;s taken an
especially rough beating from the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to tell you this,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary said somberly,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how we can save you.&rdquo; He explained
about the lowered fuel supply. Then he
reminded Spacemaster Nielson of the fact that even
should the <i>Rigel</i> enter Pluto&rsquo;s atmosphere, she
would most certainly be overcome by the same fate
that had been the <i>Capella</i>&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Rob, hearing this, made a suggestion to Spacemaster
O&rsquo;Leary. &ldquo;The two space boats may be able
to go down there and back before the frost gets
them, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Rigel</i>&rsquo;s commander looked at him gravely,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask a crewman to take a chance like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob looked at him steadily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pilot one of the
boats myself, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Allisons have more courage than sense,&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Leary retorted gruffly. &ldquo;But you can try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Stone spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the other
boat down, sir. Lieutenant Myers can fill in as navigator
if I fail to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly later, as Rob climbed into one of the
rescue craft, Duff Ford followed him, similarly
clothed in a cumbersome space suit. &ldquo;You may need
some help, Rob,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Rob smiled at him. &ldquo;Thanks, Duff. I guess I
would like some company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both youths carried heat guns, as did Lieutenant
Stone, for blasting ice. The escape locks of the <i>Rigel</i>
opened, and the boats slipped out into the vacuum
of space. The life crafts were propelled by jets of
compressed air and could seat nine men comfortably.
Both boats would thus easily accommodate
the sixteen crew members of the <i>Capella</i>. The suits
worn by Rob and Duff were like those carried by
the <i>Capella</i>&rsquo;s crew on the expedition. They were
heavily insulated, electrically heated, and contained
air spaces for additional prevention of heat loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Rob dove quickly toward the planet&rsquo;s surface.
Time was the important element in this venture.
He saw the capsule shape of Lieutenant Stone&rsquo;s
boat, which had gotten a head start, just below.
Rob felt a steady battering against the hull as he
neared the ground. This was caused by the suspended
frozen particles in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Rob opened the forward braking jets, which
poured against the big flat area of dry ice beneath.
A dense cloud enveloped the craft as the surface of
the carbon dioxide was warmed and evaporated into
gas.</p>
<p>The landing, therefore, had to be made more
through judgment than through vision. When Rob
felt a gentle bump under him, he felt immeasurably
better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was close!&rdquo; Duff remarked over his helmet
radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the lieutenant landed safely too,&rdquo; Rob
said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left his jets idling,&rdquo; Duff said. &ldquo;Maybe we
ought to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Rob agreed. Cutting down the engine
power, he then jumped out with his heat gun, followed
by Duff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The <i>Capella</i> stood about forty feet away. The flat
of dry ice was free of the cloud now, and visibility
was good under the glow of the stars and the sun,
which resembled a bright arc light. As Lieutenant
Stone came over with his gun in hand, Rob was
shocked to see a coating of frost growing over the
officer&rsquo;s suit just like a fur covering! The same thing
was happening to him and Duff, of course. Rob was
grateful for the antifreeze compound which had
been rubbed onto the facepiece of his helmet to
keep vision clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get over there,&rdquo; the lieutenant said over
his helmet radio.</p>
<p>Rob could already feel the insidious cold getting
in to him, seemingly to the very marrow of his
bones. The grimness of the situation was relieved
to some extent as he saw Lieutenant Stone crunching
along in front of him, clouds of vaporizing dry
ice swirling comically upward with every step he
took. It looked as though his boots were smoking!</p>
<p>The <i>Capella</i> was an awesome, frigid sight. Its
prow jutted upward into the twilight sky like a gigantic
icicle. It seemed unbelievable that anyone
could still be alive inside such a desolate, arctic
tomb. Rob and his companions made a quick search
about the ship to see which place had the thinnest
coating of ice on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the jet chambers are the easiest escape
openings,&rdquo; Rob suggested. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s less ice on
them than anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Stone nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start blasting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Dense white vapors poured over them from the
generated heat as they fired upward into the jet
cylinders. There were small, rocking explosions,
and balls of fire burst before their eyes. Duff was
knocked off his feet, and Rob and the officer were
shaken. Duff rose again and valiantly went back to
work with his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have ignited small amounts of explosive
gases in the atmosphere,&rdquo; Lieutenant Stone
said.</p>
<p>The explosions began to be fewer, but the white
vapors persisted. At last holes were opened in
three of the large cylinders. Rob looked up, and
presently space-suited figures appeared overhead
in the opening he had blasted out. The men quickly
hooked ladders, used for cleaning the jet chambers,
over the side and started down&mdash;clumsily after the
bitter ordeal they had gone through.</p>
<p>Some were so overcome by the raw cold they
could scarcely walk when they were outside. One
of the research scientists complained mournfully
about having to leave his equipment behind. Each
man was assisted across the ice to the waiting space
boats. Spacemaster Nielson, who appeared in somewhat
better shape than most of his men, helped in
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engines have gone dead!&rdquo; Duff noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope we can get them started up again,&rdquo;
the lieutenant groaned, helping the last crewman
he was to take into his rocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Rob told Lieutenant Stone to go on, that he had
only one more crewman to help out of the <i>Capella</i>.
Lieutenant Stone got in, closed the door, and
started up the stalled jets. They sputtered reluctantly,
then began firing evenly. Rob was grateful
to see the capsule shape lift safely into the sky a
moment later.</p>
<p>Rob and Duff returned to the doomed ship and
motioned for the last crewman at the top of the
rocket shaft to come down. The space-suited figure
was about to start when he suddenly collapsed and
fell over on the floor up above!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a boost into the chamber,&rdquo; Rob asked
Duff.</p>
<p>Duff assisted him, and he caught hold of the
lower rung of the ladder and pulled himself inside.
It was an exhausting climb up the ladder in his
bulky suit, and for a moment or two he thought he
could not make it except for the man&rsquo;s pressing
need.</p>
<p>Finally he reached the floor level and leaned
over the crewman who had collapsed. It was Jim
Hawley, his face ashy gray with cold! Rob hastily
propped him over his shoulders. In Pluto&rsquo;s light
gravity pull it was not too much of a load.</p>
<p>Carefully Rob started down the ladder. The icy
glaze that encrusted the metal rungs was treacherous.
A fall might easily be fatal, for a torn suit
would bring quick death from the temperature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Rob found Duff jumping up and down to keep
warm. He looked like a frolicking polar bear in his
frost-whitened suit. Gently Rob handed the limp
body of Jim Hawley down to Duff. Then Rob
leaped to the ground. Together they started off,
supporting Jim between them. Suddenly Duff
halted, jerking Rob backward. Rob turned and saw
Duff pointing upward at the <i>Capella</i>, which was
tottering on its base fins! The fire blasts had obviously
upset the ship&rsquo;s balance.</p>
<p>Rob motioned for them to hurry. Just as they
reached the space boat they felt the ground tremble.
They turned and saw the space ship topple
over with a ground-shaking crash and begin to roll
down the slope toward the lake of liquid oxygen.</p>
<p>Rob gave a cry of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Duff asked.</p>
<p>His voice came muffled over Rob&rsquo;s helmet. It
seemed that the freeze was going to destroy their
means of communication too. &ldquo;When the ship
reaches that lake, there&rsquo;s going to be a fierce explosion!&rdquo;
Rob replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Duff inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our heat guns warmed up the ship and when it
hits the lake,&rdquo; Rob told him, &ldquo;the liquid oxygen
will reach its boiling point and vaporize with terrific
force!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff&rsquo;s steps quickened at this, and finally the
two, with their burden, were at the craft. They
blasted at the frozen seams of the door with their
guns. Even in the few minutes&rsquo; time, layers of frost
covered the small rocket. White clouds and small
explosions accompanied his and Duff&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>The door had had to be closed in order to keep
the crewmen inside from suffering even more from
the bone-chilling temperature. Through the frosted
window Rob could see the men pushing against the
door with their feeble strength, trying to help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Rob felt panicky. It appeared that the few minutes&rsquo;
delay in rescuing Jim might cost them their
lives. He glanced down at the huddle on the
ground that was Jim Hawley. If Jim didn&rsquo;t get out
of this biting freeze in another minute, he would
probably never survive it.</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering the terrible danger from
the <i>Capella</i>, Rob glanced in its direction through
an opening in the clouds. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a break!&rdquo; he said
hopefully over his radio. &ldquo;An ice boulder has
blocked the ship temporarily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply, Rob heard only a muffled squawk over
his receiver. Their radios had succumbed to the
freeze.</p>
<p>When it appeared that the door seams were free
enough, Rob and Duff dropped their guns and began
tugging on the door. Those inside pushed at the
same time. With a tearing sound the door swung
open. Rob and Duff helped Jim in swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him on his feet and moving!&rdquo; Rob told
them, forgetting for a moment that his radio was
dead. He then made motions to show what he
wanted them to do.</p>
<p>He jerked the door partially closed, took his
pilot&rsquo;s seat, and started the jets. They choked and
gave fitful bursts. Then they died. Rob grabbed up
his heat gun and hopped outside. He crunched over
dry ice to the rear of the space boat and began blasting
into the jet tubes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The numbing glacial cold seeped through his insulated
boots and space dress. He stamped his feet
as he worked. Now and then he cast a glance at the
<i>Capella</i>, which was working free of the ice boulder
and slipping downhill again. The instantaneous
freezing nature of the climate was causing friction
and helping to delay the huge craft to some extent.</p>
<p>A moment later, when Rob decided that the jet
tubes were opened, a strange feeling came over
him. It was a mixture of giddiness and sleepy lethargy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re freezing to death!&rdquo; his subconscious
warned. &ldquo;Get moving! Get moving!&rdquo; He shook himself
and staggered back on numb legs to the door of
the space boat. His head cleared as he forced open
the door with the help of Duff from inside. He
crawled in and slumped into his seat, panting heavily
and drinking in gulps of sweet oxygen.</p>
<p>He dared not even think what would happen if
the jets should not fire this time. He switched on
the power and slammed his foot against the choking
pedal. The jets sputtered, then quickened, then
purred with regularity! Rob heaved a mighty sigh
and opened the throttle. The space boat lifted into
the sky with a jolt that caused the weary passengers
to tumble against each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>When they were well above the ground, Rob
motioned for Duff to keep his eyes on the <i>Capella</i>,
which was nearing its destruction. A moment later
they saw it plunge into the oxygen lake, and Rob
flinched. There followed a ghastly flash and roar, a
detonation that was as fierce as Rob had predicted.
The two young spacemen felt some of the shock
currents even at their height. But they were safely
above the danger, and that was all that really mattered.</p>
<p>Some hours later the <i>Rigel</i> was heading earthward
again. As soon as he was permitted, Rob paid
a visit to the infirmary where most of the crew of
the <i>Capella</i> lay for treatment. In one of the beds
Rob saw a familiar smiling face and touseled sandy
head that warmed his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, hero!&rdquo; Jim Hawley greeted. He had a comical
appearance with his cold-reddened ears and
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you doing, Jim?&rdquo; Rob asked, pressing
his shoulder gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ve got some frostbitten appendages, but
the doc says I won&rsquo;t lose any of them, thanks to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you, your whole crew was saved,&rdquo;
Rob countered. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t fixed that antenna....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked thoughtful for a moment. &ldquo;I guess
it&rsquo;s thanks to everybody on this trip, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking of the heroic work of Lieutenant Stone
and Duff on Pluto and the other crewmen who had
trusted their lives to his doubtful theory in the
Saturn crisis, Rob had to agree with him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right, Jim,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;This trip it&rsquo;s &lsquo;thanks to
everybody.&rsquo; And I can&rsquo;t say it too much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c6"><br />MERCY FLIGHT TO LUNA</h2>
<p>Toby Workman stared out of the window
of his room on the rim of the space station, wondering
what he should do. As the countless stars of
black space trooped slowly past in an endless caravan,
the boy was still haunted by the nightmare of
last week. That nightmare could yet end forever his
dreams of a space pilot&rsquo;s career. Toby was looking
in the direction of the mist-covered globe, five
thousand miles away, which was Earth. The space
station was a celestial lookout, a scientific laboratory,
and a harbor for space-going rockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking, Toby?&rdquo; asked Lou Penner,
his roommate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering if I should take Dr. Shepard and
Deb to Luna,&rdquo; Toby answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; Lou blurted. &ldquo;Do you think
they&rsquo;d ride with you after all that mess that happened
last week? Remember, too, you never did
get along with Deb&rsquo;s dad very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby turned from the window, his sturdy shoulders
slumped in defeat, a brooding unhappiness on
his sensitive face. &ldquo;You sound just like the others,
Lou,&rdquo; he said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I believe you were responsible
for the accident,&rdquo; Lou said carefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just giving
you the cold facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then over the wall speaker of their room
came another appeal for a pilot to carry the doctor
and his daughter, who was a nurse trainee, on the
desperate mission to Luna to administer antitoxin
in the sudden outbreak of contagious fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else, Lou,&rdquo; Toby said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
only licensed pilot on the space station right now.
You&rsquo;ve got fifty hours to go yet on yours, and the
express bringing other pilots from Mars won&rsquo;t be
in for a long time. A delay may let the fever grow
into an epidemic.&rdquo; Toby opened his locker and began
pulling out flying gear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try it,
Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to get the doctor to ride
with you?&rdquo; Lou wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep out of his sight until we&rsquo;ve blasted off
and are on our way,&rdquo; Toby said. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll have to
go along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Lou grinned at him. &ldquo;I should have guessed
you&rsquo;d try this, knowing how daring you are and
your mania for helping people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event which had been ruinous for Toby had
occurred when he had been piloting a sight-seeing
rocket for vacationists from Earth. It was his first
big job. While they were coming into dock on the
giant revolving wheel which was the space station,
something had happened to the braking rockets,
and the ship had collided with the hangar, injuring
several people. When it was discovered that nothing
was wrong with the rockets, Toby was unofficially
accused of negligence pending further investigation,
although his license hadn&rsquo;t been taken
away. If no mechanical defect should be found,
Toby knew he would be suspended from space flying
indefinitely, possible for life.</p>
<p>Toby had Lou inform the operations officer of
his offer to make the flight to Luna. Then he
dressed and made his way toward the inner hub of
the wheel where the vast hangar was located. He
walked along the narrow corridors in a jerky movement,
not yet having gotten used to the artificial
gravity which was created by the continual rotation
of the space station. He and Lou had been on the
station only a month. Many high-school students
came here every summer in order to build up a
flying record, thereby hastening the day when they
would be full-fledged rocket pilots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>As he looked for his ship, Toby saw the investigating
crew still examining the big craft in which
he&rsquo;d had the accident. Their significant report
might come at any time. Toby had the small rocket
flyer, which Lou and he were renting together,
towed to the air lock. Toby wished he had time to
have the ship checked, but if he waited for that,
they&rsquo;d lose their precious time advantage.</p>
<p>Toby waited, with pounding heart and idling
rocket motors, for his passengers. Presently,
through the side port of his pilot&rsquo;s compartment,
he could see the brisk strides of Dr. Shepard and
his young daughter. A steward helped the two inside
with their medical equipment, then waved a
farewell to Toby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set, sir?&rdquo; Toby called to the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Shepard returned.</p>
<p>Toby clamped shut the airtight door. He revved
the motors to launching thrust, and their roar
drowned out the quiet hissing of the oxygen out-putter.
He fastened his safety belt, told the others
to do so, and then was off.</p>
<p>When the painful effects of blast-off were over
and the ship was on a smooth trajectory, Toby
heard a click of metallic soles along the magnetic
floor and braced himself for the unpleasantness he
knew was coming.</p>
<p>When Dr. Shepard recognized him, he exclaimed
angrily, &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I, sir,&rdquo; Toby admitted. &ldquo;I knew you and
Deb had to get to Luna as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s lean, angular face reddened. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;re incompetent! I thought your license had
been revoked! If you believe you&rsquo;re doing something
heroic, Toby, consider also that you&rsquo;re risking
the lives of us who could be of service to those
stricken people on Luna!&rdquo; He paused a moment
for breath, then went on. &ldquo;A person your age has
no business flying rocket ships in the first place. It&rsquo;s
a job for older men with mature judgment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Dr. Shepard clattered back to his seat
in the back, leaving Toby with a feeling of being as
incompetent as the doctor had said. He stared
glumly out the forward port at the wrinkled witch-face
of Luna. Her gaping craters were like taunting
eyes, and her jagged mountains appeared to wear
the twisted grin of a mocking giant. Even nature
herself seemed allied against him.</p>
<p>Suddenly he had company again. It was Deb this
time. He studied her pretty face closely, wondering
if the inscrutable look on it meant that she was
one of that majority of disbelievers or whether perhaps....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Deb,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;do you believe
that accident was my fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled sympathetically, tossing her titian
curls. Her large clear eyes were sincere and direct.
&ldquo;Would it make any difference to the examining
board if I did believe in you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;d still lift my license if they wanted
to,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it would make a lot of difference
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; she said softly,
&ldquo;and I believe you, Toby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Suddenly Toby didn&rsquo;t feel quite so lonely. &ldquo;It
helps a lot to know that one person, at least, believes
in me,&rdquo; Toby said gratefully. &ldquo;Thanks, Deb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Shepard called his daughter back. Toby had
half expected Deb to say what she had. She was a
swell person. Even since she had been transferred
to his school class, he had known her as a quiet girl
who couldn&rsquo;t believe the worst in anybody. Like
Lou and himself, she was doing extra summer
work in order to earn her space nurse&rsquo;s rating
sooner. Her father was considered one of the best
space surgeons. Toby had never been one of his
favorites among the fellows who came to see Deb.
Toby had heard from Deb that her father regarded
him as reckless and too ambitious for his age. The
doctor&rsquo;s own education had been a plodding one,
hence his inability to accept the idea of young
people still in high school piloting rockets.</p>
<p>The flight continued to be a tense one for Toby
as the dragging hours passed. Dr. Shepard kept
Deb in the back, leaving Toby with only the cold
remote stars for companionship. When Toby slept,
he put the rocket on automatic pilot, but he could
not completely relax.</p>
<p>On the last leg of the journey, Toby heard a buzz
on his radio set and tuned it in. It was Lieutenant
Cameron, operations officer at the space station,
and Toby&rsquo;s heart froze with dread as his sobering
message came through:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been instructed to tell you that this is your
last trip as a pilot, Workman, at least for a long
time. The investigation of the craft in which you
had the accident is nearly completed, and there
seems to be no mechanical defect upon which the
disaster can be blamed. I&rsquo;m afraid it boils down
simply to a serious error of judgment, Workman.
I&rsquo;m sorry, but the chief says your license will be
revoked upon your return to the space station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Toby murmured, and signed off
numbly.</p>
<p>Although the message was not exactly a surprise,
Toby hadn&rsquo;t known it was going to be so hard to
take. It made him feel all empty and hopeless inside.
He had a strong urge to get up and walk right
out of the ship into the black deeps, there to drift
in the weightless vacuum forever. But the fact that
he was responsible for his passengers kept him in
his seat, told him to stick to his job and see it
through, to dare hope even in this grimmest hour.</p>
<p>At last the forward port revealed the bleak wilderness
of Luna down below. Toby lined up the
tiny space harbor in his landing sights. He placed
the rocket flyer on automatic pilot and went back
to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to land,&rdquo; he told his passengers.
&ldquo;Fasten your belts securely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>He returned to his seat and began sliding shiny
floor levers. There was a rumble of smooth gyroscope
bearings as the rocket&rsquo;s outer torpedo-shaped casing
did a complete half turn. This brought the rear
jets facing the moon so that they were in position
to act as brakes as the rocket plunged groundward.
The passengers were unaware of this, for the inner
shell in which they sat remained in its original position,
but they could feel the drag of deceleration
as the ship began losing its blazing speed. Toby
steeled himself for the agonizing pressure that
would come when the ship reached full deceleration.</p>
<p>Suddenly something prompted him to look at
the speedometer. What he saw nearly caused his
heart to stop beating. The ship was not losing
enough speed. The jets were jammed!</p>
<p>He thought how ironical it was for the very same
thing to happen to him twice&mdash;two cases of jet
braking failure&mdash;but he might never live to bear
the disgrace of this one. Nor would the Shepards,
with their precious knowledge and serum. Thinking
of them brought Toby up out of his seat.</p>
<p>Toby&rsquo;s fumbling hand found the lift stick. As the
rocket angled up from the frost-bitten ground, he
saw a racing blur of Lunar landscape, pumice
drifts, and buildings so near he could almost have
reached out and touched them. It was such a close
call that it left Toby shaking. The rocket scurried
off over the barren land like a frightened bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Toby heard a clatter down the aisle. He turned
and saw Dr. Shepard being flung about like a chip
on an ocean. Toby staggered down the passageway
after him. Necessarily rough, he shoved the doctor
back into the seat from which he had unbuckled
himself, and strapped him tightly. Deb was a pale
ghost still buckled down beside him, her eyes wide
in terror, her body tense as a coiled spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him stay put!&rdquo; Toby ordered and slipped
and slid back to the front. As the rugged moonscape
swept dazzlingly across the port, Toby headed
the rocket&rsquo;s nose upward again. A nauseating giddiness
was threatening to overcome him. Toby shook
his head vigorously and hung on.</p>
<p>When the rocket had lifted high over the planet,
he began &ldquo;purging&rdquo; the jet chambers, a procedure
sometimes effective in pulling them out of a state
of jamming. The action consisted of alternately giving
the tubes a sudden full thrust, followed by a
few moments of total inactivity. At each burst,
Toby felt as if his head would be snapped off his
neck. At last he sensed that the jets were working
freely. This was confirmed by a glance at the instrument
panel.</p>
<p>Once again he headed the ship in for a landing.
He felt the rhythmic jerks of the firestreams in normal
braking thrust, and he sighed in relief. Some
minutes later the rocket touched down gently on
the soil of the moon. They were safe.</p>
<p>Toby helped the bruised and shaken Shepards
into space suits and got them outside. He felt
pretty badly mauled himself and thought he&rsquo;d keel
over at any moment as he saw the eternal stars of
the Lunar sky grow dim before his eyes. Then someone
gave him a supporting arm into the waiting
room of the spaceport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>It was some time before Toby felt like himself.
He found that he and the Shepards, coming to full
consciousness themselves, were surrounded by
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the space service a long time,&rdquo;
Toby heard someone say, &ldquo;but that was the slickest
landing I&rsquo;ve ever seen! That young fellow must
have superman nerves to do what he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby never saw so many grinning faces watching
him or so many hands clapping him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was certainly a show of calm judgment and
expertness, Workman,&rdquo; a man in uniform said and
stuck out a big palm to him. Toby took it, blinking
incredulously, for he faced none other than Commander
Jameson, the chief on Luna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; the commander
went on, &ldquo;that I just now got a message from Lieutenant
Cameron reporting that, upon re-examination,
they found a defective valve that could conceivably
have caused your accident last week. After
your showing on this landing, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll agree
it wasn&rsquo;t a case of incompetence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; Toby mumbled, bewildered by
this sudden reversal of fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve convinced another person, Toby,&rdquo; the
boy heard beside him and saw a haggard, rarely
smiling Dr. Shepard. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve misjudged you
young people. It seems you can handle ships with
the best of them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Toby looked past the doctor and saw Deb regarding
him with quiet admiration. Her wordless compliment
was the most appreciated of them all. Who
could say but that her lone faith had kept him going
in that dark moment when he had been ready
to give up?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c7"><br />THE PERIL FROM OUTER SPACE</h2>
<p>Young Lieutenant Rob Allison rode the
escalator down the side of the space ship to the
ground. His heartbeat had increased its tempo
since he had been ordered from Earth to report to
Space Command headquarters on Luna. There had
been palpable unrest throughout Earth for several
weeks now. No one seemed to know just what it
was, but it was frightfully real&mdash;that, everyone
would admit. And Rob had an uneasy feeling that
his trip to Luna was somehow connected with the
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good ride, sir?&rdquo; a steward at ground
level asked the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Rob had not yet gotten used to being called
&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; It made him feel older&mdash;an experienced
spaceman&mdash;not his mere nineteen years of age.
More than that, it gave him a false sense of importance.</p>
<p>The steward saw before him a tall, husky fellow
who filled his space suit well. He saw a young man
who carried himself confidently, yet in no way pretentiously,
despite his unofficial nickname of &ldquo;the
Space Command&rsquo;s youngest hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s eyes roved about looking for the jeep
which General Forester had said would be here to
meet him. He glimpsed the distant Lunar panorama
which was the scene of his first interplanetary
adventure some years before. He had visited all the
planets or their moons since then. There had been
perils, defeats, triumphs. It amazed him that he
was still alive after it all. Beyond the gaunt stone
buildings of the colony, the serrated tops of the
Lunary Appenines pricked the black sky where
stars almost too many to comprehend lay scattered
like self-luminous gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Allison!&rdquo; came a voice from across
the drifts of pumice. &ldquo;Over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob approached the jeep, jogging along with the
ease of an elf&rsquo;s tread in Luna&rsquo;s light gravity. Rob
recognized a circlet of rockets on the driver&rsquo;s plastic
helmet and was both surprised and flattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Forester!&rdquo; he said over his suit radio.
He saw the officer&rsquo;s grin within the shadows of his
headgear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just about the most important person in
the world now, Rob,&rdquo; General Forester said, &ldquo;and
so I thought I&rsquo;d come for you personally.&rdquo; His narrow
brown mustache thinned to a pencil line as he
continued to smile welcomingly.</p>
<p>Rob felt a disturbing jolt within him as he heard
the general&rsquo;s words. What significance lay behind
this remark?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered, sir,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; the general said brusquely,
in a strange reversal of manner. It was odd how
quickly his sunny expression became grim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;re more interested in you for what you
can do for us&mdash;and Earth&mdash;than in your personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob felt the uneasy tightening of the noose of
suspense. He felt suddenly naked and alone, his
confidence shaky. He wanted to ask why he had
been chosen to take on an apparently enormous
task. The general anticipated him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We picked you, Rob, for this biggest of all jobs
because you&rsquo;ve been through all the terror and suspense
that the project might entail. Your reputation
for courage has caught up with you, Rob, and
we&rsquo;re going to use it for all it&rsquo;s worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob felt his pulse throbbing in his temples as
the jeep scurried over the sand dunes toward Space
Command headquarters. While his heart could
scarcely contain his excitement, his mind was
equally frantic for facts. &ldquo;What is the job, sir?&rdquo; he
asked quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve noticed, of course, the suppressed terror
of the people back home in the past weeks,&rdquo;
the general said. &ldquo;They know something big is
wrong, that their very lives are being menaced.
How they found out I don&rsquo;t know, because the
strictest censorship has been held. Maybe it&rsquo;s a sort
of telepathic hysteria that can&rsquo;t be censored. At any
rate it&rsquo;s there, and there&rsquo;s already been trouble
from it. The Command at home has been getting
crank letters demanding that we tell the people
what is wrong. This kind of thing can lead to something
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something is wrong?&rdquo; Rob ventured,
watching the officer expertly avoid a treacherous
crack in the frost-riven ground.</p>
<p>The general&rsquo;s face became haggard, and there was
a trace of terror in his own eyes. &ldquo;There is. Something
even worse than the people must suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob shuddered. All of a sudden the minus-200-degree
temperature outside his space suit seemed
to have penetrated inside. He checked the heater
and found that it was all right. No, this was a mental
chill.</p>
<p>Next came the inevitable question, &ldquo;What is this&mdash;thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your crew will be sworn to strictest
secrecy before you blast off from Luna,&rdquo; General
Forester said. &ldquo;That pledge of secrecy for you begins
at this instant. If the people back home got
even an inkling of what the trouble is, there would
be widespread panic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my word, sir,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/i1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="395" />
<p class="caption"><i>That pledge of secrecy for you begins at this instant.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>There followed an electric silence for several moments.
It was as if the general himself were rallying
courage. &ldquo;There is a giant radioactive cloud approaching
the solar system from outer space at a
terrific speed. The cloud covers an area roughly as
big as Jupiter. Scientists have been plotting its trajectory
with electronic instruments for a long time,
and there is no doubt but that it will collide with
the system if nothing is done about it. Life, of
course, would be wiped out completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob felt the horror of the statement clear to the
marrow of his bones. It left him shaking and numb.
The general noticed the effect on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it left me when I first heard
about it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;If it affects us two, who are
reasonably adjusted to the terrors of space, how do
you think it would affect ordinary persons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the shock had lessened somewhat, Rob was
able to speak. &ldquo;But you do have a weapon against
this cloud?&rdquo; he said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope we have,&rdquo; General Forester replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called Operation Big Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no more time for discussion. The jeep
topped a rise, just below which lay the hub of
buildings making up the Space Command. Rob suffered
further agony of suspense as they parked and
glided over the sands to the general&rsquo;s office in the
main building. Rob was glad to get out of his space
suit, for he had been in a cold sweat ever since he
had heard the first sobering words about the cosmic
terror. Rob and the general locked themselves in
the privacy of the latter&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;The appearance of the R-cloud, as we call it, has
necessitated using our topmost military weapon,&rdquo;
General Forester resumed. &ldquo;You and no one else
except the World Security Commission has known
that the Space Command has had for some time a
stockpile of cosmic-ray bombs which could literally
blow Earth apart. You and your crew will carry a
set of these bombs and try to scatter the mass so
that it won&rsquo;t penetrate the solar system. But of
course there&rsquo;s no assurance that the bombs can do
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob heaved a deep sigh. He knew at last what
was in store for him, but this knowledge held little
satisfaction. The things spoken between him and
the general in the few minutes they had been together
had been staggering in concept. It was hard
for him to realize that he was part of such a colossal
scheme. It was more like a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally you and your crew will run considerable
risk,&rdquo; General Forester said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told
to give you the refusal of the job if you feel that
you cannot go through with it. But I pray that
you&rsquo;ll give it considerable thought before you turn
it down. I don&rsquo;t know of a better man in the service
to trust with the future of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The future of humanity.</i> Dependent upon him,
an insignificant one of several billions who populated
Earth! The idea nearly bowled Rob over. Yet
he found himself agreeing to take on the task. He
spoke quickly lest he wait too long and find himself
withdrawing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>General Forester led him out of the building
through a connecting tunnel to a plastic-domed
hangar. Here Rob saw a little hundred-foot X-500
Cetus fighter rocket crawling with a ground crew
that was obviously readying it for flight. It was
quickly evident to Rob that the Cetus was a specially
adapted make, for it was unusually deep-bodied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your ship,&rdquo; the general explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a model that was built especially to carry the
C-bomb. There&rsquo;s one room for a crew of six. The
rest of the bulk is for shielding against radiation
from the bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob could readily appreciate this latter fact,
knowing that cosmic-ray energy was many times
more powerful than nuclear fission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the crew on Luna now, sir?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll arrive on the ferry from the space station
later today,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they retraced their way through the tunnel,
the general filled in more facts. &ldquo;We had hoped to
let the R-cloud approach closer before launching
an attack, but the pressure of public suspicion
makes it necessary to get on the job right away.
You&rsquo;ll carry the X-500 to Titan where you&rsquo;ll pick
up the bombs from our Command unit there and
get your final instructions. After that, you&rsquo;re on
your own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Six men battling the greatest pack of energy ever
faced by mankind! It was almost like tempting fate,
Rob thought; like facing a mechanized army with
only a club for a weapon. But Rob had confidence
in the scientists of this day and their devastating
brain child, the cosmic ray bomb.</p>
<p>Rob met his crew in the general&rsquo;s office. He
silently studied the young men, selected as the best
in their field, who would be entrusted with the
lives of three billion people.</p>
<p>General Forester introduced them: Mort
Haines, the chubby, burr-headed mechanic; tall,
thin-faced Lieutenant Fox, chief pilot; navigator-radiation
officer Lieutenant Swenson&mdash;big, blond
and Swedish; small, prematurely balding Goode,
the medic; and lastly the youngest of them all, the
one who made the greatest impression on Rob. His
name was Clay Gerard, a &ldquo;sputter&rdquo; or graduated
space cadet without a rating, who would fill in on
odd jobs which did not fall under the province of
his more experienced companions.</p>
<p>Clay extended a big palm to Rob. His grip
crushed Rob&rsquo;s hand. Rob looked into his expressive
blue eyes and thought he detected some amusement
in them. Rob marveled at the boy&rsquo;s muscle-padded
shoulders, thinking how well he would fit
into somebody&rsquo;s football backfield. Then it came to
him suddenly that Clay had done just that, and exceptionally
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you last season&rsquo;s triple-threat star at
Space Academy?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Clay answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you ran your opponents ragged, Clay,&rdquo;
Rob said. &ldquo;I hope you help us take care of our present
enemy the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my part,&rdquo; Clay said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to
blow my own horn, but I was champ in every sport
I entered. That ought to qualify me for this team,
shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; His lips twisted in a bantering grin.</p>
<p>General Forester broke in. &ldquo;Please observe service
courtesy, Cadet Gerard, and address Lieutenant
Allison as &lsquo;sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Clay replied. He looked at Rob. &ldquo;You
and I must be about the same age&mdash;sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subtly prolonged final word did not escape
Rob. Something warned him that he might have a
mildly rebellious spirit in his crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; Rob returned, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure both
of us will act our ages on this project. The future of
our planet depends on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir,&rdquo; Clay answered with unexpected
soberness that made Rob hope he had misjudged
him.</p>
<p>The crew was briefed in detail on the facts of
Operation Big Boy from the moment they would
depart from Luna to the final act of guiding the last
cosmic missile into their antagonist. After this, the
crew was dismissed to attend to their final affairs
and get some hours of rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Later, Rob heard that a girl by the name of Gerard
was working in the communications office, and
he went over to see if she were any kin to Clay.
Clay had left before he had heard her name spoken,
so he couldn&rsquo;t find out from him.</p>
<p>He found auburn-topped Dulcie Gerard at the
transspace radio switchboard handling a communication
between a lonely doctor on Mars and his
wife back on Earth. When it was over, she switched
off and turned to Rob with tears in her brown eyes.
&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<p>She smiled prettily. &ldquo;It was that conversation I
had on the board. It touched me, the way they
talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl stared at him so intently that
he found himself blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but aren&rsquo;t you Lieutenant
Allison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of all the wonderful things you&rsquo;ve
done,&rdquo; Dulcie went on, &ldquo;but I never thought I&rsquo;d
meet you in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob shuffled his feet in embarrassment and decided
to get down to business. &ldquo;The information
clerk down the hall told me you&rsquo;re Dulcie Gerard,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and I wondered if Clay Gerard is your
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>At the mention of the name, her face took on a
softened, somewhat tragic expression. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether he&rsquo;s my brother or son, the way I&rsquo;ve
been looking after him since our folks died a few
years ago.&rdquo; She smiled wryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re close to the
same age, but Clay seems to have a strong feeling
for family ties. He&rsquo;s not home much, but he likes
to have a home to come to when he&rsquo;s tired or just
wants to and I&rsquo;ve tried to provide it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just met your brother today, but somehow
he didn&rsquo;t impress me as being that way,&rdquo; Rob
said. &ldquo;He gives me the impression of being, well&mdash;completely
independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so polite, lieutenant. Clay&rsquo;s attitude is
painfully superior, but of course I love him in
spite of his faults. He&rsquo;s such a sweet guy otherwise.&rdquo;
Her eyes then began to glow with a deep
fear. &ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m scared to death about him.
Clay is like a powder keg, and some day somebody&rsquo;s
going to light his fuse. He&rsquo;s going to blow right up
and he&rsquo;ll be in a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob couldn&rsquo;t answer because he feared she spoke
the truth. Clay Gerard was heading for a fall. Even
in this short time, he had detected it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do, lieutenant?&rdquo; she asked
helplessly.</p>
<p>Rob wished he had an answer for her, because
already he had begun to admire this valiant young
person. But once again he had no answer, and he
told her so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dulcie said with
a sympathetic smile. &ldquo;He told me he was on your
crew that&rsquo;s leaving on a special mission today.
Maybe since you&rsquo;ve talked to me you&rsquo;ll be able
to understand him on the trip a little better anyway,
lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to do that, Miss Gerard,&rdquo; Rob promised,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll be mostly up to Clay himself.
I wish you&rsquo;d talk to him and tell him how important
it is that he make himself a part of the team on this
voyage and not just a triple-threat star. I can&rsquo;t tell
you how vital it is for him to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a terribly important flight,&rdquo; the girl
said. &ldquo;The Space Command has been using its priority
wave length more than ever in the past few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t give out any information,&rdquo;
Rob told her. &ldquo;All Space Command flights are top
secret, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But a person can&rsquo;t help wondering. I
mean after all that panic that&rsquo;s going on back on
Earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would never do for her to find out about Operation
Big Boy, Rob thought worriedly, so he decided
to end the conversation completely.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get
back to my quarters now. I&rsquo;m grateful for what you
told me about your brother. If he co-operates with
us, we&rsquo;ll go halfway with him. Just remind him of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dulcie looked at him intently. &ldquo;Clay and I are
the last of the Gerards, Lieutenant Allison. Our
heritage has been a great one, and I guess that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s helped to make Clay like he is. It&rsquo;s because
Clay is the last of our family to carry the name that
I want so hard for him to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;With a sister like you encouraging him, Miss
Gerard, I don&rsquo;t see how he can miss,&rdquo; Rob told her
gallantly and with an engaging smile.</p>
<p>Her thoughtful gaze followed his figure until it
disappeared around the far corner of the hall.</p>
<p>A few hours afterward, the six-man crew of the
Cetus X-500 was in the Space Command planetarium
receiving final briefing from General Forester.
The spacious dark room gleamed with thousands of
lights, each one of them accurately depicting a
prominent star in the heavens. General Forester
pointed to a pulsing hazy spot against the starlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the R-cloud,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really invisible,
of course, but it&rsquo;s made visible in here to show
you its location. Its apparent direction is a few
degrees south of the bright star Procyon in the constellation
Canis Minor, almost on the plane of the
ecliptic. Some of our scientists believe the cloud
was an eruption from Procyon about fifteen years
ago. Starting eleven light years away and traveling
nearly at the speed of light, it&rsquo;s just getting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I right, sir,&rdquo; Lieutenant Swenson said, &ldquo;in
assuming that there will be a colossal explosion
when our bombs contact it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; the general assured him. &ldquo;For
that reason you will release the guided missiles
when you reach the edge of the solar system. Unless
the cloud changes course, which we have no reason
to believe that it will do, the point of contact will
be ten billion miles distant from the sun. Our scientists
believe that is a safe enough distance from
us. The flash will probably be of novalike proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The general turned over to Rob and Lieutenant
Swenson, the navigator, stacks of charts and tables
that had been prepared showing the exact location
of their ship and the cloud every minute of the
way. It was a project requiring infinitely careful
calculation, and Rob marveled at the mathematical
ingenuity that had gone into the prodigious
task. A miniature of the much larger electrometer
which had first detected the menacing cloud had
been installed in the rocket fighter so that Rob
could continually keep it in his electronic sights, so
to speak, at all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will blast off at 1835, seventeen minutes
from now,&rdquo; the general concluded, &ldquo;and cross planetary
orbits under full atomic thrust to Titan. You
will land at our base there, have a final mechanical
check, and load your bombs. General Carmichael,
the chief there, will advise you of any conditions
that might have changed since you left here. After
that you will blast off to your rendezvous with the
R-cloud. Any questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were none. Like himself, Rob noted that
his companions seemed to be rather numbed by
the enormity of their task. It seemed almost ridiculous
that six persons could be expected to accomplish
the incredible job plotted for them.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">&ldquo;My sister said she talked to you,&rdquo; Clay Gerard
said to Rob when the Cetus X-500 had blasted off
and her crew had unbuckled from acceleration
couches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Clay,&rdquo; Rob answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
she was a little suspicious about our mission. Did
she try to get any information out of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob knew he had touched off a spark as Clay&rsquo;s
handsome face colored. &ldquo;Sis isn&rsquo;t one to go prying
into official business, lieutenant! That&rsquo;s why she
holds such a confidential job. Besides, I know
enough about regulations to know what I can say
and what I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get out of line, Clay,&rdquo; Rob reminded
him. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t implying that either one of you
were violating rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis is a swell guy, lieutenant. She&rsquo;s one in a
million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met her, Clay. I know she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob felt Clay&rsquo;s eyes appraising him from head
to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve been quite a star yourself when
you were in cadet school, lieutenant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
mean, since you&rsquo;ve been such a hero on different
space expeditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to do anything
extra well, Clay,&rdquo; Rob admitted.</p>
<p>Rob thought Clay looked somewhat pleased to
hear this. He wondered then if Clay had not set
him up as his own personal rival who must be overcome
as he had overcome all others he had vied
with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Rob noticed Mort Haines, the stocky mechanic,
watching them both closely from the other side of
the compartment. Was that an expression of contempt
he was directing at the strapping young
&ldquo;sputter&rdquo;? He had observed such an expression
once before when Clay had spoken of his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Rob hoped desperately that there would be no
personal conflicts. A clash of temperaments, even a
trivial one, could endanger the operation. Rob resolved
that if he did notice anyone getting out of
line he would replace the offender on Titan with a
new crew member. He could not afford to take any
chances.</p>
<p>Rob was first aware of trouble when he heard a
commotion down the corridor. He sprang from the
electroscope, where he had been checking on the
movement of the R-cloud, and clicked rapidly down
the aisle. He caught the scene in a graphic instant.
Harry Goode&rsquo;s small form was wedged courageously
between the scrambling figures of Clay and
Mort Haines. There had obviously been some blows
thrown, for there was a cut on Mort&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go, Harry,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<p>He stepped back and the combatants cooled
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<p>Mort sponged his cut with a handkerchief. &ldquo;The
big guy was bragging about the records he had set,
sir. I was busy checking a rocket chamber that was
heating up, and I told him to lose himself. He said
he had as much right in here as I did and that I&rsquo;d
have to throw him out. I was starting to oblige him,
sir, when you came in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better get back to that rocket trouble, Mort,&rdquo;
Rob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Mort said and went back into the
cramped quarters of the engine compartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry,&rdquo; Rob said to the medic, whose
sparse fringe of hair had been disordered in the
struggle.</p>
<p>Rob took Clay into the corridor where they were
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mort&rsquo;s story true?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his use of the word &lsquo;bragging,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Clay protested. &ldquo;We just happened to get to talking
about sports and I told him about the track
meet in 2002 when I set new records in the running
broad jump and mile run. Then suddenly he
springs up all red-faced, accusing me of bragging
ever since he has known me. That got me hot
then, and I guess one thing led to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob looked at him squarely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going
to have to replace you on Titan, Clay,&rdquo; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>The color drained out of the big fellow&rsquo;s face. He
was shocked. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why?&rdquo; he blurted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m afraid your attitude is a danger to
the success of the project,&rdquo; Rob said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My attitude?&rdquo; Clay asked in surprise. &ldquo;What
attitude?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think about it awhile and I believe you&rsquo;ll understand
if you&rsquo;re honest with yourself. If you can&rsquo;t
figure it out, my explaining won&rsquo;t do much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this sank in, Clay&rsquo;s initial pallidness gave
way to a red suffusion of anger. &ldquo;I know what it is!
You can&rsquo;t stand the competition! You&rsquo;re afraid the
name of Gerard will steal the glory from the Allison
reputation on this flight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there was an unexpected witness on
the scene. Lieutenant Swenson was striding rapidly
up the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help listening,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t
help putting in my two cents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He planted his stalwart body in front of Clay Gerard.
&ldquo;Lieutenant Allison is too much of a gentleman
to give you the lesson you deserve, Gerard, so
I&rsquo;ll do it myself verbally&mdash;and physically too if
you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of your name competing with his in
reputation is laughable. He&rsquo;s set records for unselfish
service you&rsquo;ll never touch. You&rsquo;ve set your
records for personal glory, but his were an outcome
of risking his life to save his friends. And
what Lieutenant Allison meant by your attitude
was a polite way of saying you&rsquo;re a troublemaker
and an unmitigated braggart. Every word you speak
is a challenge to someone. Tell me, have you ever
lost a race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Clay returned meekly, under the
shock of the officer&rsquo;s blast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re losing this one. You&rsquo;re not good
enough for this team, Gerard, and you&rsquo;re going to
be put ashore on Titan. I can&rsquo;t imagine a person
who calls himself a spaceman and takes the oath of
allegiance to duty letting petty interests take first
place in an operation as important as this. I don&rsquo;t
believe you have realized yet that the future of
life itself on Earth depends on the success of this
flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Lieutenant Swenson seemed to
have run out of steam as his big chest gasped for
breath. Clay was so overcome he stood with lips
trembling and eyes smarting. Rob suspected this
was perhaps the first real dressing-down he had had
in his life, something that probably his own father
had never done.</p>
<p>Clay Gerard said nothing in defense.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Swenson turned to Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
Rob, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. When I heard him
blast out at you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob remained silent and Lieutenant Swenson
walked off with some embarrassment.</p>
<p>Just then the rocket fighter angled up and sent
Rob and Clay rolling over against the wall of the
corridor. Clay&rsquo;s head thumped against the metal,
and the blow appeared to daze him. Rob helped
him up as the ship continued to rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Rob asked him.</p>
<p>Clay shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Rob hastened to the engine room, some impulse
telling him that the misbehaving rocket chamber
might be behind the trouble. He found Mort in
front of an opening in the floor, a frantic look on
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rocket cylinder that was heating up has
blown a leak!&rdquo; he shouted above a deafening
swooshing sound from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you repair it?&rdquo; Rob asked. &ldquo;The ship is
practically out of control!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Lieutenant Fox to cut all jets and keep her
even,&rdquo; the mechanic said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go down
into the hold to plug the break-through so it&rsquo;ll last
until we reach Titan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob leaned over the hold and felt hot air rushing
up at him. It was dark and crowded with machinery
down there. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can work
down there in all that heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mort shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to, or we may never
land. If I&rsquo;d checked it when I had that tangle with
Cadet Gerard I might have saved the blowout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob sensed someone behind him and turned to
see Clay, who had followed him into the engine
room. Rob saw a stark look on the cadet&rsquo;s face as
though the grave significance of his clash with Mort
were suddenly made startlingly real to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo; Clay asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can, we&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo; Rob told him
as he hurried from the room toward the pilot&rsquo;s
nest forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>After instructing Lieutenant Fox, Rob returned
to the engine room. As though anxious to make
himself useful, Clay was leaning over the hold into
which Mort had disappeared, pointing a flashlight
for him. The other crewmen, except for the pilot,
were gathered around in a tense knot. By now, the
ship had leveled off somewhat and the unevenness
was less severe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Mort coming?&rdquo; Rob asked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s complaining of the heat, sir,&rdquo; Harry said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s liable to collapse down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob leaned over the hold. &ldquo;How are you, Mort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly through!&rdquo; came a feeble reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sounds weak,&rdquo; Lieutenant Swenson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish one of us knew how to repair the damage,&rdquo;
Rob said. &ldquo;We could give him relief.&rdquo; He
turned to Clay. &ldquo;Let me have the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob shone the flashlight around the confining
interior of the rocket hold. He could see the squatting
figure of Mort in the far corner pressed against
the huge glittering curve of the jet chamber.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Mort had just announced that the
job was completed when there was a burst of radiant
light that filled the entire hold. An acrid, burning
smell swirled into the room above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me that fire extinguisher!&rdquo; Rob cried and
began lowering himself. Someone thrust the CO&#8322;
extinguisher from its wall rack into his hand, and
he disappeared into the smoky hold. Through the
gray veil that choked the basement room, Rob
could see growing lurid flames. He pointed the
extinguisher full into the fire and saw white clouds
of carbon dioxide suffocating the blaze. When he
could see no more redness, Rob moved forward and
tumbled along the floor for Mort. He retched and
coughed from the smoke. He&rsquo;d be needing help
soon.</p>
<p>His probing hands finally located Mort&rsquo;s inert
body and he began dragging it back toward the
opening in the ceiling. A few steps away and under
the hole he found Lieutenant Swenson waiting
there to help. The navigator took the heavy weight
from his arms and handed it up through the circular
opening to the others. Then he turned to give
help to Rob.</p>
<p>When Rob had recovered sufficiently several
minutes later, with no more than a tight chest and
raw throat, he checked with Harry Goode, who had
put Mort to bed as soon as he came out of the hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he, Harry?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<p>The medic shook his head gravely. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
look too good to me, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a
lot of burns and he swallowed plenty of smoke.
He&rsquo;ll be a lucky guy if he pulls through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew this might happen when he took that
welding torch down there,&rdquo; Rob murmured. &ldquo;But
he knew the job had to be done.&rdquo; He coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me check you over too, lieutenant,&rdquo;
Harry said. &ldquo;You swallowed some smoke yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Rob said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the space
surgeon look at me on Titan, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Rob went back to join the others. When he told
them the unfavorable news about Mort, a gloomy
silence settled over the compartment. Mort had
been well liked, having quickly become a friend
to all except Clay Gerard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I checked the hold when the smoke lifted,&rdquo;
Lieutenant Swenson said, breaking the oppressive
stillness. &ldquo;Mort&rsquo;s torch must have touched off latent
gases in the chamber. There&rsquo;s some charred machinery
down there but no real damage from the explosion.
Fox said the ship&rsquo;s moving all right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay seemed ashamed to gather here with the
others. He was lingering in the corridor looking
out the port. Rob had begun to feel sorry for the
young fellow whose quarrel with Mort had led to
such tragic results. Rob went out to join him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly time to take to landing couches,&rdquo; Rob
remarked as he saw the curved, mistbound world
that was Titan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Clay answered, without spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me tell the others about Mort&rsquo;s
condition?&rdquo; Rob asked.</p>
<p>Clay barely nodded. &ldquo;If he dies, I will be the
one who killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault that he was hurt,&rdquo; Rob
soothed. &ldquo;He knew what he was getting into when
he went down into the hold with the torch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we hadn&rsquo;t fought he could have prevented
the blowout,&rdquo; Clay argued. &ldquo;I heard him
say it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s to be any blame for the accident, it&rsquo;ll
rest with the inspection team back on Luna which
should have found the weakened temper of the
chamber. They have stress gauges to detect such
things, and they should have found it, particularly
on a ship whose mission is so important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay smiled wanly. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re just trying
to make me feel better, lieutenant. The truth of
the matter is that I&rsquo;m everything Lieutenant Swenson
said I am. I know now what sort of unselfish records
he said you&rsquo;d made. It was just like the one
Mort made when he went down into the hold,
knowing the risk he was taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, given time, you&rsquo;ll make a good spaceman,&rdquo;
Rob said.</p>
<p>Clay&rsquo;s unhappy face studied the approaching
world outside for several moments in silence until
there came the pilot&rsquo;s report of altitude and Rob
knew it was time to strap down. Lieutenant Fox
switched in the robot pilot that would make the
landing and joined his companions on the row of
degravity couches in another compartment. All
buckled the plastic belts across their bodies and
yielded themselves to the discomfort of swiftly cutting
speed.</p>
<p>As soon as the ship landed, Rob unbuckled and,
with Harry Goode, hurried to the compartment
where Mort had been placed. Harry took the injured
man&rsquo;s pulse and told Rob that it was weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him to the infirmary immediately,&rdquo;
Rob said and went to the radio nook just off the
pilot&rsquo;s nest. He put through a call to the Space
Command headquarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Carmichael speaking,&rdquo; came a firm,
booming voice over the amplifier. &ldquo;Come in,
X-500.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Lieutenant Allison, sir,&rdquo; Rob spoke.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had an accident aboard and a man has been
badly hurt. Will you send out a stretcher for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;What was the
man&rsquo;s duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mechanic 101, sir,&rdquo; Rob answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a replacement for him,&rdquo; the general
said. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re on the subject of bad news, Allison,
I&rsquo;ll give you mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, sir?&rdquo; Rob asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that the people of Earth are closer than
ever to panic stage,&rdquo; said General Carmichael. &ldquo;A
switchboard operator on Luna half guessed our secret
and when she telephoned someone on Earth
the operators back there picked up the message.
You won&rsquo;t have much time for layover here, Allison.
You&rsquo;ll have to be off almost immediately so
that we can report success of Operation Big Boy as
soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob suddenly went cold with dread and disappointment.
Dulcie Gerard, whom he had considered
one of the squarest persons he had ever met,
had suddenly destroyed his faith in her completely.
It made Rob wonder if making themselves unpopular
wasn&rsquo;t a confirmed Gerard trait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Some minutes later, Rob and his crewmates solemnly
followed the stretcher bearers out of the
ship. Through the plastic airtight case Rob could
see the still-as-death figure of the burr-headed mechanic
who had risked his life for his friends. The
party trooped across the ice slick that lay between
the X-500 and Space Command headquarters on
Titan.</p>
<p>General Carmichael met the group inside the
air lock of the headquarters. His small, sharp eyes
looked out from under thick gray brows at the
identically dressed men before him, streams of condensed
vapor rolling off their glossy suits.</p>
<p>Rob pulled off his helmet and advanced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Allison, sir,&rdquo; he said, offering his hand.</p>
<p>The wiry general shook hands briskly. &ldquo;Glad to
meet you, Allison.&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot
to do, so we may as well get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Carmichael led them into his private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mechanic replacement will be over
shortly,&rdquo; the officer told them when they were
seated. &ldquo;His name is Olney. A good man. You&rsquo;re
lucky he was available. We&rsquo;re kind of shorthanded
here and really can&rsquo;t spare anyone. None of us on
the project thought your crew would have to be
replaced at this final stage, but of course accidents
can&rsquo;t be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Rob glanced over at Clay Gerard. Rob thought
he detected a flicker of hope in the youth&rsquo;s eyes.
Rob pondered deeply, wondering if he should go
ahead with the replacement of Clay as he had said
he would do. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to explain
Clay to General Carmichael. Giving the appearance
to Rob of being a strict old-timer, the chief
officer did not look to be too understanding a person
on a matter such as this. Then too, he had said
he simply had no other men to spare.</p>
<p>And yet Rob knew he must consider his other
crewmen. If Clay were unreliable, what right had
he to risk their lives just to give a mixed-up young
fellow another chance? Rob didn&rsquo;t know what to
do, so he looked to his friends for advice. He resolved
to act on their judgment, since they were
older men. Rob caught Lieutenant Swenson&rsquo;s eye.
To his wordless inquiry, the navigator-radiation
officer nodded. Lieutenant Fox did the same. The
silent vote had given the impetuous Clay Gerard
another chance, and for some reason Rob was glad
that it had come out this way. Clay, who had been
watching the other raptly, knew he had been reinstated,
and he smiled his gratitude.</p>
<p>General Carmichael handed each of them pencil-like
tubes which he told them they would wear
in their upper blouse pockets at all times during
the flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These instruments record cosmic-ray radiation,&rdquo;
the general said. &ldquo;As you know, a concentration of
these rays will cause agonizing death. You will be
the first crew ever to carry C-bombs on a mission
because fortunately we&rsquo;ve never had to use them
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Less than an hour and a half later, the Cetus
X-500 was ready to go. General Carmichael replaced
the charts given Rob by General Forester
with ones carrying figures for the accelerated moment
of departure.</p>
<p>Rob considered Bruce Olney a capable fill-in for
the valiant Mort Haines, if looks were any criterion.
He was a slender, straw blond, with intelligent
eyes. He wore a miniature good-luck horse-shoe
charm around his neck.</p>
<p>A report from the infirmary showed that Mort
Haines was still in serious condition. Rob saw
Clay Gerard wince as he heard the news. Clay had
been an exceedingly quiet individual since the accident
to the mechanic, a different person entirely.
His blatant self-confidence had been whittled down
strikingly to a brooding reserve.</p>
<p>When the crew of the X-500 was already in the
ship and about to blast off, General Carmichael
spoke his final disturbing speech over their radio,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had another report from General Forester.
The people are mobbing the White House
demanding to know what it is that threatens their
lives. The President doesn&rsquo;t believe he can hold
them off much longer.&rdquo; The general&rsquo;s tone became
grimmer and more emotional as he concluded.
&ldquo;Operation Big Boy has got to be a success, Allison.
There&rsquo;s no two ways about it. I want the next
message you send to give the good news that we
will immediately broadcast throughout the system.
Good luck and God be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The six of them stared at one another soberly
as the final words were spoken. The full enormity
of their duty seemed to have struck them just now
for the first time. Rob choked down the lump that
pressed up into his throat. He took a full breath,
readying himself, then gave his first command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast-off couches,&rdquo; he spoke quietly. &ldquo;Prepare
for launching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the roaring thunder of the blast-off was
behind them and the rocket ship was grasping for
the stars, Clay unbuckled his straps and turned to
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Dulcie spread that report about
our project, lieutenant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t
lose her head. Not her. She&rsquo;s the calmest one in the
family. Besides, she&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Gerard?&rdquo; Rob supplied, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>Clay flushed. &ldquo;I guess I haven&rsquo;t really changed,
have I?&rdquo; he said bleakly.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s brows furrowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to believe she
didn&rsquo;t do it too. But she&rsquo;s the switchboard operator
on Luna. She was on when we left. Who else could
it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There still must have been someone else,&rdquo; Clay
persisted. &ldquo;I know my sister too well. She would
have known what would happen if she had spoken
openly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>After setting the ship on course and under full
rocket thrust, Rob and Lieutenant Swenson took
time to study the elaborate firing mechanism in the
navigator&rsquo;s compartment that would send the
bombs on their way a few hours from now. The
electroscope which gave the reading on the R-cloud
was located nearby. The gauge had shown consistent
increase ever since the blast-off from Titan, indicating
that they were drawing closer to the cosmic
menace all the time.</p>
<p>Within the next half hour tension had grown
nearly to fever pitch, and yet there was still some
time before the crucial zero hour. Rob found himself
pacing restlessly about the navigation compartment.
Lieutenant Swenson was rattling keys in his
pocket, and Rob guessed that the others must also
be similarly tightened up.</p>
<p>Clay&rsquo;s grinning face appeared at the door of the
navigator&rsquo;s cabin. The young cadet looked as calm
as if he were on nothing more than a sight-seeing
tour. He carried a tray on which sealed containers
filled with lavender drinks were held by magnetism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about some palm-berry tea, gentlemen?&rdquo;
he said, setting the tray down on a magnetic table.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Swenson smiled at the youth whom
he had tongue-lashed on the previous flight.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lifesaver, Clay,&rdquo; he said, picking up a container
and beginning to suck on the connected
straw.</p>
<p>Palm-berry tea was a tasty beverage made from
a dwarf Venusian swamp plant. It was a splendid
sedative for &ldquo;space nerves&rdquo; and was always carried
on long voyages. Under the harried circumstances
of their blast-off, Rob had forgotten to have a supply
of the tea put aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; Rob asked, taking a
glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would come in handy, sir, when our
stomachs got to knotting up,&rdquo; Clay replied, &ldquo;and
so I got a box from the commissary just before
coming aboard. Every crew has to have a cook, so
I elected myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a change from the self-centered young fellow
he had first met, Rob thought. It was amazing
that Clay Gerard, who before must be first in everything,
was now satisfied at being what he called a
&ldquo;cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay distributed drinks to the rest of the crew.
In a little while the epidemic of jitters had subsided
almost completely.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged on as the Cetus X-500 sped
toward the bright star Procyon and the malignancy
it was believed to have cast into space. When the
crew spotted little Pluto plodding his lonely way
through the empty deeps, they knew they were at
the edge of the solar system.</p>
<p>Another hour slipped by, and Lieutenant Swenson
began lining up the target on the ground glass
of his visi-screen table. The electroscope showed a
high count, and the meters Rob and the radiation
officer wore were also showing the mounting ray
penetration from the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; weapons below the insulated
flooring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few minutes to go, Rob,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Swenson said, studying his screen. &ldquo;Better check
your bomb release.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Rob checked and found it ready to go. His fingers
itched to pull the lever. Sensing the approach
of zero moment, the others drifted into the compartment.
The robot pilot was driving the ship, and
even Lieutenant Fox had come in. A dozen eyes
pored silently over the screen table.</p>
<p>Rob could count every tick of his watch. As the
final minutes slipped away, he withdrew from the
circle and went over to the bomb release. His hand
was clammy as it palmed the smooth metal lever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Rob,&rdquo; Lieutenant Swenson spoke in a
dramatic whisper. &ldquo;A few minutes more&mdash;twelve&mdash;nine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compartment was silent as a tomb except
for the soft throb of the ship&rsquo;s power plant. Rob&rsquo;s
eyes drifted out the side port, and the stars out
there dazzled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;two&mdash;one&mdash;<i>fire</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s hand shoved forward. A muted rumble
came from the floor. The noise swelled to a full-bodied
roar. Then there was a banshee-like scream,
and Rob knew the first bomb had flung itself into
space.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Swenson counted off five more seconds,
and then Rob sent the second bomb on its
way. This happened four more times, and each time
Rob heard the final shriek as the missile cast itself
into the vacuum. Rob didn&rsquo;t hear the last bomb
scream. His ears were ringing too much from the
clamor of the previous ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>When it was all over, the purr of the power
plant began dissipating the throbbing ring in
Rob&rsquo;s ears. He felt a tremendous relief now that
the job was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long before we&rsquo;ll see the bursts?&rdquo; he asked
Lieutenant Swenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for hours,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,
the missiles have a long way to go even though
they&rsquo;re speeding fast as blazes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t know until then whether we&rsquo;re
successful?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the navigator said.</p>
<p>Rob checked the compartment cosmic-ray counter
and his own pencil meter. &ldquo;The radiation ought
to start diminishing now that the load is gone,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>He was mistaken, he discovered later, when the
ship had been swung about on its gyros and was
heading homeward. The radiation had begun increasing,
in fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; Rob said worriedly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing down below to make the radiation
concentration rise. If this keeps up, we won&rsquo;t
last out the trip back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minutes later, as the concentration continued to
build up, Rob knew there had to be something
down there that was giving off the dangerous emanations.
There was no other explanation that he
could think of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce,&rdquo; Rob said to the new mechanic, &ldquo;can
you check the bomb chamber without direct exposure?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The mechanic nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an antiradiation
compartment up forward with an insulated window
where I can take a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bruce left the room to check, Rob thought of
something. &ldquo;Did any of you hear the scream of that
last bomb leaving the chamber?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>When no one said anything, he continued, &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ve got the answer. That last bomb must
have jammed and didn&rsquo;t come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His guess proved substantially correct. When
Bruce returned, he reported that the heat of the
bomb racing along its launching track had fused
with part of the track so that both hung out of the
bomb hatch and were being carried along with the
ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky those bombs were made to go off
only on contact with the powerful omega rays in
the R-cloud,&rdquo; Rob spoke grimly, &ldquo;or we&rsquo;d be somewhere
up in the Milky Way by now! We&rsquo;ve got to
get that bomb away from the ship before its radiation
kills us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropping that bomb off isn&rsquo;t going to be any
sweet job,&rdquo; Bruce commented. &ldquo;But being the mechanic,
it ought to fall to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Rob cut in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a job any of us can
do. It&rsquo;ll take more courage than skill to cut the
track off with an oxygen torch. By fastening the
torch on the end of one of our emergency insulated
rods, the operator can work at a distance with less
chance of radiation exposure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Swenson volunteered for the job,
then Clay. Rob knew they had no time to wrangle
over who was going to do it. Lieutenant Fox suggested
drawing straws, and everyone agreed this
was the fair method of deciding. Rob got six
matches and broke one off shorter than the rest.
Then he held them out for drawing. Bruce drew
first and revealed a long one. Clay drew the next
one and said simply, &ldquo;You can stop drawing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob was confident Clay could handle the job all
right, for use of the acetylene torch was emphasized
in cadet training.</p>
<p>The youth was assisted into space gear, and the
cutting torch was fastened to the end of the insulated
rod. A crude shield was also fashioned from
some of the insulation of the ship so as to further
protect Clay from the bomb&rsquo;s radiation. Even with
all this, however, there was no small amount of risk.
But Clay seemed happy to have drawn the job and
went about his preparations lightheartedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s final warning,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t get the fire from your torch onto the bomb
or none of us will live to tell about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay left the ship through a side air lock, carrying
his odd equipment and secured to the ship by
a length of space chain so that he could not drift off
into space. The eyes of the crew followed him
through the port near the door as he crawled along
the hull and downward toward the bomb rack.
Then they lost sight of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>As they turned from the port, Harry Goode
stooped and picked up a match from the floor.
&ldquo;This is Clay&rsquo;s match,&rdquo; he said, holding it up. &ldquo;I
saw him drop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a <i>long</i> match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tricky guy!&rdquo; Rob muttered, with a wry
grin. But what he really said in his mind was, &ldquo;That
<i>great</i> guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is anxious to make good,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Swenson said with admiration.</p>
<p>Bruce led them toward the bow of the ship
where they could see Clay work on the damaged
bomb hatch. They moved along a narrow aisle lined
with throbbing turbines and finally down an aluminum
catwalk, at the bottom of which was the
doubly insulated inspection chamber containing a
large observation window that looked out onto the
skin of the craft.</p>
<p>The men crowded around the quartz port and
watched Clay make his circuitous approach to the
bomb hatch. Rob admired his skill in staying at the
full taut length of his space chain so as to keep the
maximum distance between himself and the &ldquo;hot&rdquo;
chamber. Clay drifted like a feather in the weightless
void, handling his equally light equipment
with ease as he brought it into position.</p>
<p>Rob imagined the vacuum out there to be fairly
crackling with radioactivity and potential death
rays. Clay had known they were there too. Yet he
had gone out willingly, risking his life.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Clay&rsquo;s hand guided the burning instrument to
within inches of the top of the bomb.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Keeping his shield deftly in front of him, Clay
lit his torch with his free hand, and the brilliant arc
light burst like a nova on the eyes of the watchers.
Clay next shoved the insulated rod, to which the
torch was attached, toward the hatch. Slowly, cautiously,
he moved the tool in closer. Only a short
way below hung the gray cartridge that was the C-bomb,
and the warped track that dipped out of the
hatch and downward.</p>
<p>Without a tremor, Clay&rsquo;s hand guided the burning
instrument to within inches of the top of the
bomb. Rob shuddered to think what fury could be
unleashed should the torch drift too close to the
bomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s got what it takes,&rdquo; Lieutenant Swenson
murmured, his subdued voice sounding
strangely loud in the deathly quiet. &ldquo;He knows
what&rsquo;s at stake, but he&rsquo;s not excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay got the flame against the track which was
the only thing holding the C-bomb to the ship.
Then he began the slow, labored process of severing
the tough titanium alloy. The intense heat of the
oxygen-fed torch turned the metal red hot. Then
another danger came into the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can the heat from the track set off the bomb?&rdquo;
Harry put the danger into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could,&rdquo; Rob replied grimly. &ldquo;It probably
won&rsquo;t, but it could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the suspenseful minutes that followed,
Rob heard one sucking sound after another as those
around him breathed irregularly. The hot touch of
the men&rsquo;s bodies against him betrayed their tension,
their prayerful hopes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easy does it, Clay,&rdquo; Rob thought. &ldquo;Just a little
more, and the track will be cut through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scarlet track and the blazing spot of the torch
seemed to sear a hole right into Rob&rsquo;s eyeballs.
&ldquo;How can Clay stand it this long himself?&rdquo; he wondered.
&ldquo;His nerves must be of steel wire, his pupils
of quartz lenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The track is cut through!&rdquo; someone finally exclaimed
exultantly.</p>
<p>Yet even with the worst part behind him, Clay
didn&rsquo;t get overconfident. As the bomb hung there
weightless in space, Clay carefully withdrew the
rod and the torch from its dangerous proximity to
the bomb. Then he shook off the torch until it
began drifting away from him, whence it would
travel unchecked until it passed into the gravitation
field of some celestial body. Next Clay gently
brought the rod end against the bomb and shoved
ever so lightly against it. Then it too began creeping
away slowly into the black deeps, never to be
seen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Bruce gasped, and Rob could sense the
relief of tension in those around him.</p>
<p>Clay discarded the rod then but kept his shield
in position as he made his way around the radioactive
bomb hatch and back toward the air lock
where he had left the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has discarded his hot equipment,&rdquo; Lieutenant
Swenson said as Clay moved out of their field
of vision. &ldquo;Just like a natural-born spaceman&mdash;he
didn&rsquo;t forget a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>When Clay had been helped into the ship with
unnecessary care, each of his shipmates gave him
an exuberant slap on the back and covered him
with words of praise that fairly inundated him.
Rob could see a grin a light year wide on the boy&rsquo;s
face and the trace of tears too as he realized he had
been accepted as one of them again.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Swenson summed it all up when he
said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an all right guy, Clay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry tore off Clay&rsquo;s space suit, which was discarded,
and began giving him all sorts of tests for
radiation exposure. But Clay had protected himself
well and was &ldquo;clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invisible peril within the ship began slacking
off steadily, and later Lieutenant Swenson announced
that the moment of the first bomb&rsquo;s strike
was at hand. The six gathered about the lookout
refractor telescope in the ship&rsquo;s stern which had
carefully been directed upon the determined spot
of impact at their rear.</p>
<p>Rob was the first to see it through the prism
eyepiece. Against the unchanging star patterns
there was suddenly a brilliant flare like a ton of
magnesium bursting into flame before his eyes. It
blinded him for a moment with its radiance, even
though there was a filter over the field lens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hit it!&rdquo; he breathed thankfully and turned
away so that the others might see the succeeding
strikes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>To make sure the destruction was complete, Lieutenant
Swenson pored over the electroscope for a
long time afterward and finally made a significant
announcement. &ldquo;Operation Big Boy is a success,&rdquo;
he said softly. &ldquo;Not only has the cloud been broken
up, but its remnants will pass far out of range of
the solar system. Rob, you can radio the folk back
home and give them the good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob lost no time in getting to the set and pouring
out the happy tidings to General Forester on
Luna.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">Later Rob learned of the repercussions: &ldquo;The
people in most quarters are stunned to know what
could have happened to them,&rdquo; the Space Command
officer told him. &ldquo;But all danger of panic is
over. People are leaving the streets and going back
to their homes and loved ones&mdash;and to church. It&rsquo;s
a grand victory, Rob, your greatest of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my victory, general,&rdquo; Rob replied. &ldquo;It
belongs equally to the men with me&mdash;Fox, Swenson,
Olney, Goode, and Gerard. They&rsquo;re great guys,
sir, all of them.&rdquo; Rob had started to mention Mort
among the names and inquired how he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Carmichael radioed that he has passed
his crisis and is conscious,&rdquo; was the gratifying answer.
&ldquo;The doctor says he&rsquo;ll make it all right. Rob,
Miss Gerard is anxious to talk to you and her
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Rob couldn&rsquo;t understand how Dulcie could still
be on the job if she had committed the serious
indiscretion of exposing the secret flight. This
prompted Rob to ask the general about it. The
chief officer replied that it hadn&rsquo;t been Dulcie Gerard
but a temporary substitute who had taken
over for her. As a matter of fact, Dulcie had been
very angry at her friend for what she had done.</p>
<p>Dulcie was allowed to talk to Rob, and the first
thing she said was, &ldquo;Can I speak to Clay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming down the hall,&rdquo; Rob told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how did Clay do on his first
assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob paused a moment, then replied, &ldquo;Somebody
lit the fuse under him like you said, Dulcie. He
didn&rsquo;t blow into little pieces, though. The explosion
knocked the worst out of him but left behind
something fine and unselfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I could cry!&rdquo; the girl blurted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is now,&rdquo; Rob said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him tell you
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay took the mike from Rob. Rob watched in
admiration as Clay modestly told her the whole
story, minimizing his own glory. Clay might be the
last of the male Gerards, he thought, but he would
certainly not be forgotten. As long as men had
breath to speak, they would talk about the real
hero of Operation Big Boy&mdash;and how he almost
came to miss the trip altogether.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c8"><br />THE GHOST SHIP OF SPACE</h2>
<p>Rock Merrill looked interestedly at the
man who had introduced himself as Tony Kalmus.
He had told the young former cadet that he had
come all the way from Earth to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than that,&rdquo; the man assured
him. He was still fairly young, although his blond
hair was balding on top. He shifted his heavyweight
frame, that filled the chair snugly, but with
deliberate slowness dug through the inner pockets
of his blue jacket and brought out a folded piece of
paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>At that moment Shep Dubois came into the dormitory
aboard the space service station that was
25,000 miles above Earth. Centrifugal force, provided
by the rotation of the station, gave an artificial
gravity so that its occupants could walk about
normally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Rock?&rdquo; Shep asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rock answered. &ldquo;I just got a
message over the wall speaker that this Mr. Kalmus
had come to the station to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock introduced the two formally. Then Kalmus
gave Rock the piece of folded paper. Rock opened
it up. It was a photostatic copy of a torn blank
scrap of paper. Rock studied it for a moment, his
heart gradually increasing its beat as he unconsciously
felt that he was on the verge of a big discovery.
The ragged edges of the photographed
scraps looked strangely familiar. Then suddenly the
answer came to him in a rush that sent his blood
throbbing hard through his temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the missing
scrap from the <i>Sagittarius</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that after twenty years it&rsquo;s turned
up?&rdquo; Shep said in amazement. &ldquo;Now you may be
able to find the <i>Northern Cross</i>, Rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Kalmus said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
leave you the photostat to compare with your own
scraps, Merrill, and then you&rsquo;ll know I have the
missing piece for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do have it, Mr. Kalmus, I&rsquo;ll be indebted
to you forever,&rdquo; Rock said enthusiastically. &ldquo;Ever
since I first wanted to be a spaceman it&rsquo;s been my
ambition to look for my dad&rsquo;s lost ship. But how
did you know where to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;I asked around. Your mother told me over the
phone back on Earth that she was pretty sure you
had the scraps with you and that you treasured
them as if they were gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Rock admitted, staring out one of the
oblong ports of the dorm at the salt-and-pepper
background of interstellar space. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the last
link I have with my father. I never saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kalmus got up. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re convinced I&rsquo;ve got
what you want and you&rsquo;re ready to listen to a proposition
about locating your dad&rsquo;s lost ship, just let
me know. I&rsquo;m in Room 38, Deck B, overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kalmus had gone, Rock went to his
dresser and began searching a drawer. &ldquo;The box
with the scraps is in one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still find all this hard to believe!&rdquo; Shep said.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see how Kalmus could have gotten
hold of the missing scraps. They were supposed to
have been destroyed with the <i>Sagittarius</i> except for
the ones they salvaged for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about that now, Shep!&rdquo; Rock
told him. &ldquo;The main thing is to fit the puzzle together
and find the answer that I&rsquo;ve wanted to
know all my life&mdash;the location of the <i>Northern
Cross</i> and its treasure ore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Rock&rsquo;s father, Victor Merrill, had been a space
surgeon accompanying a research expedition to
Venus before Rock was born. Mineralogy was Dr.
Merrill&rsquo;s hobby, and while on the planet he had
come across a curious mineral in a cave. Returning
to Earth, he&rsquo;d had the sample analyzed. The mineral
was alconite, a very scarce and valuable component
of an alloy used in the construction of radioactivity
shields. Told that a space-ship load of the
light mineral could bring him a fortune, Dr. Merrill
set out again for Venus with his own expedition,
financed from his life savings, planning to
build a satellite hospital with the proceeds of the
venture.</p>
<p>Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s ship, the <i>Northern Cross</i>, had
landed on Venus, and a load of the mineral was
stocked aboard the ship. But then disaster overtook
the party, the first of many tragic events that were
to follow. A landslide sealed off the mine, burying
most of Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s crew. The four remaining, including
Dr. Merrill himself, blasted off for Earth,
but not having enough experienced men to adequately
run the vessel, the ship was wrecked by
an explosion. An SOS was radioed to a freighter
bound for Venus, the <i>Sagittarius</i>. The radio operator
made a note of the <i>Northern Cross</i>&rsquo;s position,
but shortly afterward, the <i>Sagittarius</i> itself, in a
hurry to reach the stricken <i>Northern Cross</i> and
with a faulty radar set, collided with an emergency
fuel buoy floating in space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>When later ships salvaged the wreck of the <i>Sagittarius</i>,
scraps of the radio operator&rsquo;s note were
found, but not enough of it to establish the &ldquo;fix&rdquo;
of the still missing <i>Northern Cross</i>. These scraps
had later been turned over to Rock and held by
him ever since. He had stubbornly clung to the
fragments in the wild hope that some day he might
obtain some other clue to the location of his father&rsquo;s
ship.</p>
<p>The last message from the radio operator of the
<i>Northern Cross</i> had reported that the ship had lost
its power of navigation after falling into a perpetual
orbit about Venus. Therefore Rock and his
mother had known for years that Victor Merrill&rsquo;s
ghost ship had become a satellite of the planet
Venus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, Shep!&rdquo; Rock exclaimed, pulling a
flat tin box out of his dresser drawer.</p>
<p>They eagerly took the box and the photostat over
to a table. Rock unlocked the container and gently
removed the scorched and yellowed fragment that
had been pieced together with transparent tape.
He fitted the section against the ragged edges of
the full-size pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fits!&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<p>Swiftly the coming events passed hopefully before
his mind&rsquo;s eye. He visualized a search for the
<i>Northern Cross</i>, a search that might yet bring a
fulfillment of Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s unselfish dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Mr. Kalmus wants out of this?&rdquo;
Rock mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A share of the treasure, I&rsquo;d guess,&rdquo; Shep replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t be absolutely sure of finding
the <i>Northern Cross</i>, even with the exact &lsquo;fix,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Rock said. &ldquo;If it changed its flight path after sending
the SOS, there&rsquo;s not much hope. But if it held
its same orbit, as Dad&rsquo;s radio operator reported, we
should be able to locate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we listen to Kalmus&rsquo; proposition?&rdquo;
Shep suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better!&rdquo; Rock agreed.</p>
<p>As they went down the corridor, they met
Johnny Colfax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m going to tell those guys
what they can do with their old job, especially that
little worm, Mugger!&rdquo; Johnny complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired of all this backbreaking stuff and his fussing
at us all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re all tired of it, Johnny,&rdquo; Rock sympathized.</p>
<p>Johnny was one of seven of them who had accepted
work on the servicing station after their
washout from school. Since they knew they could
never go into space in the smart livery of the Space
Command, this seemed to be the next best thing.
But the boys had soon tired of the glamour of being
out in the deeps and the hard work, and most of
them were ready to go meekly back home to Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe before long,&rdquo; Rock told his discouraged
friend, &ldquo;all of us will be able to tell the big boys
where to head in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along and see,&rdquo; Shep invited.</p>
<p>Johnny made a wry face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the mood
to see anything now. It&rsquo;s the sack for me and ten
solid hours of sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Rock and Shep looked for Kalmus&rsquo; room on Deck
B. As they passed a long corridor port, they saw the
busy outside activity of the servicing station. They
saw big clumsy-looking astroliners and streamlined,
needle-prowed &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; ships approaching
and leaving the docks of the octagon satellite after
repairs or refueling. Smaller ferry craft darted back
and forth between the vessels like pilot fish in the
company of great sharks.</p>
<p>The boys located Kalmus&rsquo; room and found him
waiting for them as though he had known they
would be along. There was another man present.
He looked like a walking skeleton, with thick black
brows and hands like hairy tarantulas. Kalmus said
his name was Jack Judas and that he was a close
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My scraps match your photostat, Mr. Kalmus,&rdquo;
Rock said. &ldquo;What is your proposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right to the point. We go on an expedition
to look for the <i>Northern Cross</i> and split the
value of the cargo if we find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s reasonable enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can rent an old ship cheaply,&rdquo; Kalmus went
on. &ldquo;Got a friend in the business over on Satellite
7, a space supply moon. He showed me just the
thing for us, atomic drive and all, equipped to
carry eleven men. I can dig up a crew too. How
much money can you get to pay for your share?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will take some figuring,&rdquo; Rock said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll have to talk over the proposition with the other
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d furnish the crew,&rdquo; Kalmus said,
with a trace of annoyance. &ldquo;However, if you want
to bring some of your buddies along, I guess that&rsquo;s
your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together all through Academy
training,&rdquo; Rock told him, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s too long a
time to split up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock was able to get all his six friends together
to talk over the plan, even rousing a complaining
Johnny Colfax out of his brief sleep. All were in
favor of making the voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll split my share equally among us,&rdquo; Rock
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on that, Rock,&rdquo; tall, wiry Hugh Blankenship
objected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your dad&rsquo;s ship and we know
about his dream to build a satellite hospital. Besides,
you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s been holding the clue
to its location all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk that over later,&rdquo; Rock answered.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to decide how we&rsquo;re going to split
expenses with Kalmus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had accumulated tidy sums while working
at the space station. Even Rock had a fair
amount of savings despite the fact that he sent
much of his monthly check home to his mother.
Space pay was high, and the boys had had no place
to spend their money. But of course it cost a lot of
money to take a ship out into space. The boys figured
that the best they could do would not be
quite enough. Rock told them that he had an idea
Kalmus would advance them some on their share.
It was likely that he wouldn&rsquo;t have come this far
without being sure the trip could be financed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Rock next told them about Kalmus wanting to
furnish most of the crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all of us go,&rdquo; said little Sparky Finn, with the
bristly hair, &ldquo;then Kalmus will have to limit the
men he wants to take. It&rsquo;s a simple matter of arithmetic&mdash;seven
of us and four of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him that,&rdquo; Rock agreed. &ldquo;We all go or
none of us goes. I&rsquo;ll insist on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reckon we can trust Kalmus?&rdquo; Ed Somerton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks all right to me,&rdquo; Shep said, &ldquo;although
of course you can&rsquo;t trust first impressions sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks all right to me too,&rdquo; Rock agreed.
&ldquo;But just the same, while we&rsquo;re waiting to get the
ship outfitted, I think I&rsquo;ll check his references at
central identification headquarters on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they were going to break up, there came
a sharp rap on the dormitory door. Before the visitor
could be invited in, he flung the door open and
strode inside.</p>
<p>Rock flared at this invasion of their privacy, especially
when the newcomer proved to be a person
disliked by all of them. He was Carl Mugger, their
immediate supervisor. Behind his back he was
known as &ldquo;Yap&rdquo; because of his shrewish tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we got here&mdash;a tea party?&rdquo; he
blurted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, a private discussion,&rdquo; Rock answered
evenly, trying to control his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of you are supposed to be on duty,&rdquo; Mugger
went on. &ldquo;You fellows think you&rsquo;re on a vacation
or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were only doing routine work in the solar
mirror relay.&rdquo; Hugh spoke for Ed, Leo Avery, and
himself, who were the three Mugger had been talking
about. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only been here a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think would happen to the station
if I took off any time I wanted to?&rdquo; he demanded,
drawing his short body up to its full height.</p>
<p>Getting no reply, Mugger ranted on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood
just about all I&rsquo;m going to from you guys! The next
time one of you goofs off I&rsquo;m going to have you sent
back so fast Earthward your heads will buzz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at each of them in turn.</p>
<p>Shep stepped forward, a full half head taller than
the little man, his face reddening from the fury
mounting in him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the others,
Mr. Mugger, but I&rsquo;m fed up with this station and
you too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mugger&rsquo;s jaw muscles twitched and his eyes
flashed. &ldquo;Do all of you feel this way?&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>The others hesitated. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the smartest
thing to cut oneself off from his job 25,000 miles
above Earth and with no other work in sight, but
neither could a fellow let his buddy stand alone in
something on which all of them were in sympathy.
Rock made the first move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that way,&rdquo; he said boldly, and the others
backed him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows are through!&rdquo; Mugger said coldly.
&ldquo;You may as well get your things together and be
ready to take the next ferry ship going Earthward!&rdquo;
He turned and went out.</p>
<p>Shep&rsquo;s natural color was beginning to return. A
look of penitence came over his thoughtful face.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, fellows. I&mdash;I just couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bound to happen, Shep,&rdquo; Rock consoled
him. &ldquo;But it does sort of throw us in with Kalmus
in a hurry, and it means we can&rsquo;t afford to talk up
to him quite as strongly as we might have otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to know we&rsquo;ve been fired,&rdquo; Leo
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rock answered with
some concern. &ldquo;Otherwise he&rsquo;ll set his own terms,
and we&rsquo;ll just have to take them. Remember, we
don&rsquo;t even have enough money to pay our share of
the expenses, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock and Shep went to see Kalmus immediately.
Jack Judas was present, as well as another man. He
was squatty and sturdily built, with hair as black
as the Coalsack. Kalmus introduced him as Ben
Spooner.</p>
<p>Rock outlined the terms he and his friends had
drawn up. Kalmus listened to them thoughtfully
and impassively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could bring some experienced men if you&rsquo;d
let me have my way,&rdquo; Kalmus said when Rock was
through. &ldquo;You fellows are pretty young, and on top
of that you are washouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t wash out until the finals,&rdquo; Ed told
him. &ldquo;We still learned a lot about piloting and navigation
in our training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Leo agreed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to worry
about us getting the ship there and back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kalmus saw how determined all the fellows
were to go, he shrugged. &ldquo;I guess you know
what you can do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take care
of most of the running of the ship. I&rsquo;ll have with
me Ben, Jack, and Mumbly. That will make a crew
of eleven, the ship&rsquo;s capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re agreed on that,&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judas knows a little about piloting and can help
out if necessary,&rdquo; Kalmus went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a
brother who&rsquo;s first mate on a space freighter and
has flighted with him a few times. Pegg and
Spooner and I were steward&rsquo;s helpers on a few
space flights some years back. When can you fellows
be ready to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Rock answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock straightened in surprise. They could hardly
make their plans in that short time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get started,&rdquo; Kalmus said.
&ldquo;You fellows turn over to me all the money you
can get together, and we can settle for the rest
when we get back. I wouldn&rsquo;t even hold you up for
this but the dock fee and license have to be paid in
cash before we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, wait a minute!&rdquo; Rock protested, with a
laugh. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re underestimating the work
we&rsquo;ve got to do. We&rsquo;ll have to make a trip back to
Earth and get the ship and supplies lined up first.
That alone will take much more than a few hours!
It&rsquo;s twenty-five million miles to Venus at the closest
approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve checked on Venus with the chief astronomer
on the observatory satellite,&rdquo; Kalmus declared,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;re in the best position if we start as soon
as possible. I&rsquo;ve also taken care of everything else,
and I&rsquo;m still ready to leave in a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock shook his head as if he still could not believe
this. &ldquo;You realize there&rsquo;s a chance we might
not find the <i>Northern Cross</i>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Rock
warned.</p>
<p>Kalmus&rsquo; face grew taut. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the chance
that all of us will have to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He headed for the door. &ldquo;Come with me,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led them down the long companionways to
Hangar 7 on the outer rim of the station. Supplies
were being loaded here through the station air lock
into a globular nonatmospheric ship that was anchored
by its magnetic grapples to the side of the
station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Tony Kalmus waved his hand at the activity and
smiled at the surprised faces of Rock and Shep.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our ship,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Meet the <i>Dog
Star</i>, fellows. She&rsquo;s all ready to go treasure hunting!&rdquo;</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">The little space ship <i>Dog Star</i> was on its way into
deep space with its crew of eleven. The ex-cadets
had sent messages home telling of their departure.
But Kalmus had been in such a hurry to leave that
they did not even have time to wait for replies. Nor
had Rock had time to check on Kalmus&rsquo; references
back on Earth.</p>
<p>Rock could appreciate the need for haste, however.
Unless they left when they did, Venus would
have moved out of its most favorable position, and
it would have required much more expenditure of
fuel to overtake her later.</p>
<p>It would be several weeks before the <i>Dog Star</i>
approached the misty planet and&mdash;it was hoped&mdash;the
twenty-year orbit of the ghost ship <i>Northern
Cross</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re on our way, fellows,&rdquo; Rock remarked
to his young friends who were gathered
with him in the navigation room looking out one of
the ports. &ldquo;I wonder what the stars have in store
for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we should have brought along an astrologer,&rdquo;
Hugh said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more faith in our own abilities, Hugh,&rdquo;
Rock said. &ldquo;The Cadet Board doesn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve
got what it takes to be spacemen. We can prove
them either right or wrong. It&rsquo;s strictly up to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Now that the detailed task of getting the ship
underway was over, the time seemed ripe for the
pooling of information that would give the travelers
the exact location of the <i>Northern Cross</i>.</p>
<p>Kalmus and his three companions joined Rock&rsquo;s
party in the navigation room, Kalmus having
brought along his own precious scrap from the record
of the <i>Sagittarius</i>.</p>
<p>With the ship on autopilot, its course having
been computed on the electronic brain, the eleven
gathered around the navigator&rsquo;s table on which
were laid out sky charts and the important bits of
paper.</p>
<p>The men and youths were able to stand about in
this manner because of magnetically charged shoes
which clung to the floor. Without them, the travelers
would have hung weightless in the zero-gravity.
The atomic power rockets had already cut their
thrust after reaching required velocity, and the
ship was now in free flight.</p>
<p>Rock fitted the torn fragments together on a
white sheet of paper as Kalmus, breathing hard,
leaned over his shoulder. Rock tore off some transparent
tape and carefully stuck the whole together.</p>
<p>The radio operator&rsquo;s record listed certain numbers
and letters that had their counterpart on the
sky map. Rock traced the &ldquo;fix&rdquo; on a large detailed
map of Venus and its environs, his finger finally
stopping on one significant spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the <i>Sagittarius</i> had last contact
with the <i>Northern Cross</i>,&rdquo; Rock said with suppressed
excitement. &ldquo;The radio man said the <i>N.C.</i>
was already in free fall around Venus.&rdquo; He traced
an imaginary path around the planet with his finger.
&ldquo;This orbit is our destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship will be somewhere along there, providing
it didn&rsquo;t slow down afterward and fall into
Venus,&rdquo; Shep pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; Rock agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know the
answer in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kalmus told the boys how he had come into possession
of his scrap with the priceless information.
He said that his friend in the space salvage business
who had rented them the <i>Dog Star</i> had had on
hand some of the things from the destroyed <i>Sagittarius</i>.
One day he had found the yellowed bits in
with some bulkhead parts. He mentioned this to
Kalmus, who looked up the old newspaper accounts
of the double disaster and prevailed upon his
friend to give him the valuable scraps. Then he had
made his plans for recovering the <i>Northern Cross</i>.</p>
<p>Rock was elected chief navigator and leader of
his group. Kalmus, of course, was already head of
his own group.</p>
<p>The <i>Dog Star</i>&rsquo;s direction known now, Rock sat at
the keyboard of the electronic brain and &ldquo;typed&rdquo;
out the corrected ship&rsquo;s path. The complicated
math problem was solved quickly, and the answer
tape was then fed into the automatic pilot. Only
minor corrections of the controls for direction
would have to be made by hand until the ship
reached its destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>In the space days that followed, the two groups
kept pretty much to themselves. Even eating and
sleeping were carried on in separate quarters. Since
this was a voyage for mutual gain only, all preferred
such an arrangement. Kalmus and his friends
prepared their meals in the galley at a set time, and
the boys took a later meal hour.</p>
<p>One day when the boys were reading and playing
quiet games in the lounge to pass the long hours,
they heard a commotion from Kalmus&rsquo; part of the
ship. Rock got up from the game of chess he was
playing with Shep and went to the door. Kalmus
was approaching briskly down the corridor, his big
frame making his hard-soled shoes thump loudly
against the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Rock asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A meteor tore through the ship just a few feet
from Mumbly,&rdquo; Kalmus replied. &ldquo;Mumbly was so
scared when he heard it that he nearly jumped out
of his skin! He left the floor and floated clear up to
the ceiling! We had to pull him down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock and some of the other fellows went to
investigate.</p>
<p>The room pressure was still up, but Mumbly
Pegg, the near-victim, was pale clear up to his disordered
shock of red hair. Kalmus&rsquo; stoop-shouldered
friend kept mumbling how close he had come
to being killed, a mannerism that had gained him
his nickname. He talked incessantly to himself,
neither getting a reply from anyone nor expecting
any.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Rock found holes in opposite sides of the room
where the meteorite had hurtled through. The
holes were only about pea-sized and were scorched
around the edges. The automatic sealing compound
would keep the air in the ship from leaking out
temporarily, but a permanent repair would have to
be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hull&rsquo;s got to be soldered from the outside,&rdquo;
Rock told Kalmus. &ldquo;Some of the boys and I will go
outside and take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep and Johnny offered to go with Rock, and
the three put on pressure suits. Then they took up
their firing equipment and prepared to enter the
air-lock tunnel leading outside.</p>
<p>Before unscrewing the hatch, Rock took in hand
one of the safety mooring lines that was fastened
to the edge of the hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These safety lines aren&rsquo;t the best I&rsquo;ve ever
seen,&rdquo; Rock commented, as he observed some worn
places in the nylon. &ldquo;Kalmus must have had these
given to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wants to get rid of us,&rdquo; Shep said,
half-seriously.</p>
<p>The boys hooked the safety lines to their suits,
then climbed out the circular hatch into raw space
itself. They still wore magnetic shoes to counteract
their weightlessness and enable them to walk.</p>
<p>The boys took one moment to feast their eyes on
the brilliant fields of star dust that surrounded
them like a great dome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Spellbound by all the vastness, Rock was comforted
by the solid feel of the big round globe beneath
their feet. He looked at the long narrow
stem that jutted out the back of the sphere and
held the smaller shielded ball of the screened-off
atomic power plant. The engines were still idle;
they would be until it was time to spin the ship
around and blast away forward to slow the ship
down a few weeks from now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Earth over there at &lsquo;7 o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo;&rdquo; Shep
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a fuzzy, unripe peach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of makes you homesick, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Rock
said a little wistfully.</p>
<p>They went over to one of the meteorite holes and
knelt down.</p>
<p>The bright fire leaped like a hot bar from Rock&rsquo;s
cutting torch, reddening the metal of the hull almost
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is this going to take?&rdquo; Johnny asked
worriedly. &ldquo;I want to get back inside. I don&rsquo;t trust
these dilapidated safety lines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to regret I brought you fellows
along on this thing,&rdquo; Rock said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Kalmus
got me so excited about the expedition that I
guess I didn&rsquo;t really consider the risk we were taking
by venturing into space on our own. There are
so many things that could go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have to come,&rdquo; Shep encouraged
him. &ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;d have gone anywhere just to get
away from the station. I&rsquo;ve been miserable ever
since we flunked out. Just a few trick questions and&mdash;WHAM&mdash;there
were three years gone to waste!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they won&rsquo;t be wasted if our reward is the
finding of the <i>Northern Cross</i>,&rdquo; Rock pointed out.</p>
<p>He found that he could work better by taking his
feet off the hull and &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; face down over it,
with Shep holding on to his safety line to prevent
the blast of the torch from driving him outward.
Johnny was busy holding the flux in position.</p>
<p>Suddenly the force of the blast caused Rock&rsquo;s
worn safety line to snap and sent him hurtling outward
from the hull of the <i>Dog Star</i>!</p>
<p>Rock heard his own name blasting into his ears
as the anguished voice of Shep called to him. Then
he saw his friend leap upward with clutching futile
hands. Shep&rsquo;s body jerked to the end of his own
line, and then the reaction sent him slamming back
onto the hull.</p>
<p>As Rock, still numb with shock, sped farther outward,
he heard the frantic calls of Shep and Johnny
trail off as their radio power faded. Finally no
sound reached his ears, and the oppressive silence
of lonely space closed in on him. It had all happened
with such suddenness that he could scarcely
realize it had happened at all.</p>
<p>Hopelessness had already begun to get a hold on
him before he began to think of how he might save
himself. Perhaps it was something he had learned in
cadet training that made him calm himself and
think reasonably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>His stiff fingers still clutched the cutting torch
that had rocketed him from the <i>Dog Star</i>. Why not
use it the same way to get back? Although still
streaking out laterally from the ship, he was under
influence of the ship&rsquo;s motion and was traveling
just as fast beside it.</p>
<p>Rock carefully judged his direction and blasted
with the tool in the opposite direction. He felt the
deceleration of his outbound speed as the firestream
braked him. Presently the rocket reaction
stopped him and he began going back toward the
ship.</p>
<p>Rock used the cutting torch for a brake to slow
his return onto the skin of the hull. Shep and
Johnny clattered over to him and pulled him in to
safety. Rock could see relief spreading over their
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you&rsquo;re safe, Rock!&rdquo; Shep said.
&ldquo;You nearly gave us heart failure! You sure kept
your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t, Rock told himself grimly, he would
not be here this minute. A spaceman had to keep
his head at all times. His cadet training had impressed
that on him.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">The days and weeks that followed passed uneventfully,
if not exactly excitingly. There was so
little to do, such a monotony of scene.</p>
<p>A few thousand miles from the Venus orbit,
Rock fed directions for a gyroscope turn into the
automatic pilot, and the rockets began spouting
bursts of flame to check the <i>Dog Star</i>&rsquo;s headlong
rush. All aboard were forced to take to shock
couches for the first time to lessen the pain on
their bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Had time not been a factor, Rock could have
decelerated slowly with no strain. This had been
the manner of their acceleration from the station.
But Rock had realized that Kalmus would become
impatient later and so had figured the flight for
rapid deceleration and consequently much saving
of time.</p>
<p>Kalmus and his men took the deceleration shock
in different ways. Since all the couches were in the
same room, Rock could study their reactions. Jack
Judas and Kalmus made no outward signs of discomfort,
but Spooner and Pegg groaned continually.</p>
<p>Although not exactly enjoying himself either,
Rock, like his young friends, had been taught to
take this, and through a certain pride would give
no outcries. The lessening speed constricted the
blood vessels in his eyes, blurring his vision, but
Rock kept studying the reflecting prism over his
cot to take his mind off the strain. And his hand
did not drift far from the emergency controls
should something go wrong.</p>
<p>The prism brought the outside view right into
the ship. Venus dominated the scene, like a giant
snowball glittering with a light of its own. Rock
could see the impenetrable clouds, chiefly of carbon
dioxide, swirling and crawling over the surface
of the planet like a tide. The invisible lands below
were a hothouse of wind-swept desert and barren
stretches. There were only a few isolated research
settlements down there where brave scientists
probed the hot soil for strange new things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>When the <i>Dog Star</i> slowed, the travelers were
able to leave their couches.</p>
<p>Rock consulted the charts and got a reading of
their position from Ed, who was at the navigation
instruments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Rock said, indicating a spot on
one of the maps. &ldquo;At Point X we&rsquo;ll match orbits
with the <i>Northern Cross</i>, then we&rsquo;ll accelerate a
little so that we&rsquo;re bound to overtake her eventually&mdash;that
is, if she&rsquo;s still in her original flight orbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to be there!&rdquo; Kalmus cried a little
frantically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve poured a fortune into this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got as much interest in this as you have,
Tony,&rdquo; Rock told him evenly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re no expert
Spacemen, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re going right so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The travelers began watching the radarscope for
first signs of the ghost ship. But no &ldquo;blips&rdquo; showed
on the screen. Later, every crewman was assigned a
watch at the &rsquo;scope. This was intended to keep a
man continually on duty.</p>
<p>When the ship moved in exposure to the sun,
the ports had to be shielded with filter screens. An
outside movable reflector blind, highly polished
and operated automatically by a thermostat, reflected
away much of the heat and light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Despite its dangerous aspects, the sun was a magnificent
object. Its white-hot surface was eye-searing
bright and showed dark islands of sunspot activity,
any one of which could swallow Earth. Its edges
threw out mountainous red tides that lapped outward
many thousands of miles into the black deeps.
It was a sight that brought a lump of awe into one&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<p>When he was on duty at the &rsquo;scope, Rock used
the ship&rsquo;s small refracting telescope to see the little
yellow disc of Mercury, dwarfed like a pinhead beside
a grapefruit, against the sun. It reminded Rock
of a small dog taunting a larger one, daring it to
attack, yet forever skipping nimbly out of the way
with its agile speed.</p>
<p>The hours of search drew into a full space day,
then another, with no sign of the ghost ship. Even
if the <i>Dog Star</i> had been off course a few hundred
miles, a ship as large as the <i>Northern Cross</i> could
not have slipped by unnoticed.</p>
<p>Finally Rock had to make a gloomy announcement.
&ldquo;In another hour we&rsquo;ll have made a complete
revolution of Venus,&rdquo; he told all ten of them who
were gathered around. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t come across
the <i>Northern Cross</i> by then, it means she&rsquo;s not in
her orbit. She&rsquo;s either crashed on Venus or has
gone out into space. We&rsquo;ve been accelerating faster
than an object in free fall around Venus. She
couldn&rsquo;t have outrun us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kalmus&rsquo; big palm slapped the table. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
stand for being licked, Rock! I&rsquo;ve built my hopes
so high on this thing!&rdquo; His pale eyes glared restlessly
and there was a red suffusion over his face.</p>
<p>Rock reminded him, &ldquo;The matter isn&rsquo;t in our
hands. We&rsquo;ve done all we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Kalmus lapsed into nervous silence as the minutes
ticked off. He haunted the radarscope most of
the time and even tried to look for the ship with
the refractor, a tedious job. He was in a constant
fidget, alternately pacing and putting his eye to the
instrument.</p>
<p>Now only fifteen minutes remained. There was
still no sign of the ghost ship. Rock also was beginning
to feel a growing despondency. Up until now
he had not considered the consequences of failure.
Now it shocked him to do so. He and his friends
would be indebted to Kalmus for years to come for
their share in the venture. They would either have
to slave at the space station again, and eat humble
crow, or try to find other jobs back on Earth.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t all of the story. A failure would
close off for all time the hope that had lived in him
ever since he had known of his father&rsquo;s disappearance.
He would have to resign himself to the
thought that his father and his ship would speed
along with its lifeless cargo to the ends of the universe
seemingly, never to be recovered. And worse,
Merrill Memorial Hospital would remain only a
shattered dream that might have been.</p>
<p>Then there was the reaction of the unpredictable
Kalmus to be considered. Would he turn on them?</p>
<p>Five minutes to go. No ship in sight. Nothing
but star dust and more star dust and the smoldering
light of Sol, like a mocking beacon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Finally Rock had to say bitterly, &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up.
I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re licked. There&rsquo;s no sign of the
<i>Northern Cross</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find that ship!&rdquo; Kalmus cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
search for it if it takes a hundred years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good to search without knowing
where to look,&rdquo; Rock reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt to try anyhow,&rdquo; Kalmus proposed.
&ldquo;We might be lucky. I&rsquo;ve sunk too much in this
expedition to turn back now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still intend to pay up our share of the costs,
Tony,&rdquo; Rock assured him. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry
about that part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding the ship means as much to you as it
does to me&mdash;or so you said, Rock,&rdquo; Kalmus went
on stubbornly. &ldquo;Why are you giving up so easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it means a lot to me, but I&rsquo;m not going
against terrific odds. It would be crazy.&rdquo; Suddenly
Rock thought of something and turned to
Sparky Finn. &ldquo;Sparky, are you absolutely certain
you figured out that navigational problem correctly?
Yours was the trickiest of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went over it twice, Rock,&rdquo; Sparky replied solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better look at it again,&rdquo; Rock proposed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a possibility we might have botched up
our figures somehow. If your calculation is right,
we&rsquo;ll all recheck ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sparky&rsquo;s math proved to be correct. Then each
of the boys went over his own figures again. Halfway
through his, Hugh caught an error in his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take me for a numbskull!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Look
what I did! No wonder I flunked out in cadet
school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too far out from Venus,&rdquo; Rock told Kalmus.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go in closer to the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Dog Star</i> swung into its new orbit. Kalmus
became enthusiastic again, and Rock felt that they
would meet with success this time, but if they
didn&rsquo;t, there was nothing more to do but admit
defeat.</p>
<p>It was Johnny Colfax who first spotted an interesting
&ldquo;blip&rdquo; on the radarscope screen two space
days later. Half the eleven-man crew was asleep,
but Johnny&rsquo;s shouts brought everyone running into
the main control room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Rock, I think I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock set the telescope in synchronization with
the radar set. Then he put his eye to the telescope
eyepiece and turned the hairline focus adjustment.
Yes, it was really a cigar-shaped craft, man-made,
just about the general shape the <i>Northern Cross</i>
was supposed to be. It was a streamlined ship built
to slide through the atmosphere of Venus.</p>
<p>Rock judged it to be a few hundred miles away.
&ldquo;It seems to be the <i>Northern Cross</i>,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that thing!&rdquo; Kalmus blurted and
pushed up to the telescope. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our dream
ship!&rdquo; he purred, like a miser over his gold sacks.
&ldquo;I can almost see a dollar sign on that baby!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>A few gentle manual corrections later brought
the <i>Dog Star</i> alongside the ghost ship. The smaller
ship&rsquo;s crew clustered at the broad port. Only a few
thousand yards away, the ship was a giant thing,
gray and meteor-scarred from the years that it had
wheeled about in space, alternately feeling the torrid
heat of the naked sun and the bitter cold when
the sun was eclipsed behind the big planet.</p>
<p>As Rock stared, his heart beat faster. Here was the
graveyard of his valiant father and his crew who
had battled nature for a share of her wealth and
had lost. Rock felt a mixture of feelings&mdash;of repulsion
and of being drawn to the scene. He was attracted
by thoughts of the treasure ore that might
fulfill his father&rsquo;s dream of a satellite hospital, but
he was repelled by thoughts of what he might find
in that space tomb.</p>
<p>Although circling the planet Venus at high velocity,
both ships were as if stationary in space and
in relation to each other. Rock, Shep, Hugh, Kalmus,
and Judas suited up in preparation to going
outside and across to the other ship.</p>
<p>With an extended safety line securing himself
to the exit door of the <i>Dog Star</i>, Rock was the first
to launch himself into the gulf between the ships.
He carried a length of electrical cable which he
would attach by magnetic force to the side of the
<i>Northern Cross</i>. Then his companions could hook
onto the cable with their own safety lines and cross
the gulf without risk of drifting off. They had done
some repair work on the unsafe lines that had given
them trouble before. They felt more secure with
them now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>After the cable was set up, Shep pushed off from
the doorstep of the <i>Dog Star</i>, and his momentum
carried him through the vacuum toward Rock on
the other side, his safety line slipping along the
cable for security. Behind Shep, the others followed.</p>
<p>Shep had brought two cutting torches for opening
the door seams of the <i>Northern Cross</i>. He
handed one to Rock and they both set to work, the
brilliant flare of their tools lighting the blackness
like twin novae. The sun was on the other side of
the space ship, leaving this shadow side in absolute
darkness.</p>
<p>Finally the door was cut all around. All that it
appeared to need now was a good strong push.
Rock and Shep tried it together, a little gingerly
perhaps as they realized their weightlessness, and
hence, helplessness. The door hung stubbornly in
place. When Kalmus saw their ineffective efforts,
he lifted his big booted feet and boldly slammed
them hard against the door. The door section caved
inward, but the reaction sent Kalmus scooting backward.</p>
<p>Kalmus gave a terrified yell as he went drifting
all the way back to the other ship. Not knowing
how to navigate in weightlessness, he barged into
the wall of the <i>Dog Star</i> with such force that it
caused him to bounce back across the gulf again.
His safety line kept him from being in any danger
of caroming off into space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Hugh, holding on to the ship, caught Kalmus&rsquo;
body as it came back to them. The big fellow was
moaning from fright, and the boys got secret enjoyment
out of Kalmus&rsquo; comical and harmless
experience.</p>
<p>Then Rock sobered quickly as he faced the grim
task that was to follow. He sighed heavily and
stepped through the opening into the air-lock tunnel
of the ghost ship, followed by the others. His
shoes clung to the floor, indicating that the magnetic
floor current was still going after twenty
years. Leaving the air lock, Rock and his companions
found themselves in a lounge. Everything was
in neat order, just as if it had been set to rights only
today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in excellent preservation!&rdquo; Rock marveled.
&ldquo;The reflector blinds must have kept the temperature
in here pretty even through all the years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found other parts of the ship also in neat
order. Rock had been told by his mother that his
father had been a very orderly man. As yet there
was no sign of what had made the vessel a ghost
ship.</p>
<p>Rock dreaded every new room they entered.
Which one would reveal to him the skeletons of
the ghost crew&mdash;one of them his father&rsquo;s, a father
he had never seen?</p>
<p>The searchers carried Geiger counters as a check
on stray radioactivity from the atomic engines. But
so far the only clicks the meters gave off were apparently
from the ever-present cosmic rays out in
space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Since no bodies had yet been found, it was supposed
that the four crewmen were together in one
place. The searchers had entered the <i>Northern
Cross</i> near the rear and had been working their
way forward. Rock guessed that the bodies must be
in the main control room.</p>
<p>In the galley, remains of a meal were still inside
sealed plates. The bits were rock hard. An examination
of wall pressure gauges showed that the entire
ship was open to the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the ore?&rdquo; Kalmus growled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the looks of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The search party moved down ghostly corridors
that hadn&rsquo;t felt the thump of space boots for two
decades. Just before reaching the main control
room, Rock came to a door-marked, &ldquo;Stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be it!&rdquo; he said hopefully and opened
the door.</p>
<p>No one needed to tell anyone else that this was
the goal they had been looking for. It was a vast,
oblong cell, its metal bins piled nearly to the ceiling
with gray lumps of rock. The rest of the room
was crowded with mining equipment. However,
the bigger stuff had evidently been left on Venus.</p>
<p>Kalmus gave a shout and flung himself into one
of the bins. He fondled the stones, bathing himself
in the wealth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rich! I&rsquo;m rich!&rdquo; he kept saying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Rock turned away disgustedly, his young friends
following. For some reason he almost wished their
mission had been a failure. Sharing this treasure
that his father had died to accumulate for unselfish
motives made Rock feel sick for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go into the pilot&rsquo;s room, Rock,&rdquo; Shep
asked in gentle consideration, &ldquo;or shall we just pass
it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Shep, I&rsquo;ve got to see if Dad is in there,&rdquo;
Rock answered.</p>
<p>Leaving Kalmus and Judas to play in their
wealth, the three youths left the room and moved
farther down the corridor to the main control
room, the door to which bulged outward. It took
considerable ramming to force it open.</p>
<p>The disorder of the compartment was in shocking
contrast to the neatness of the rest of the <i>Northern
Cross</i>. Plastic seats were warped, and it looked as if
a giant with a padded sledge hammer had gone
about recklessly putting dents in the lightweight
metal of the walls. An emergency air lock stood
wide open, revealing the stars, its door hanging
by one hinge. It was on the side away from the
<i>Dog Star</i>. The huge console that housed the instruments
and gauges also showed great depressions,
and nearly all the glass dial covers were shattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think happened in here, Rock?&rdquo;
Shep asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a high-pressure build-up of gas,&rdquo;
Rock answered. &ldquo;Probably in the ventilating system.
When the pressure got too high, either the air
lock was the first to give way or somebody opened
it in desperation. I imagine all the men were
trapped in here and couldn&rsquo;t get the door open.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>There were no bodies in the room. All four had
evidently been swept through the air lock by the
rapidly escaping gas. Rock&rsquo;s companions could read
the truth as easily as he had done himself, and they
were considerate enough to remain silent. Rock
stared about him for several moments. This was so
unexpected, not finding his father. He didn&rsquo;t quite
know how to take it.</p>
<p>The boys went out to join the others. Kalmus
and Judas were chattering over their success, already
making plans for the future.</p>
<p>Kalmus was not concerned whether Rock had
found his father or not. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry up and get
this stuff loaded on the <i>Dog Star</i>,&rdquo; was the first
thing he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Rock said absently.</p>
<p>As they went aft again, Rock&rsquo;s mind was full of
what they had seen. He was rather disappointed in
the way he felt. He had thought he would be jumping
in elation when they found the alconite ore.
Instead, he was almost sorry. It seemed like a violation
of his father&rsquo;s honor to share his property
with these men of greed.</p>
<p>The shock of not finding his father&rsquo;s body continued
to disturb him. He had hoped to take it
back and give it a decent burial. Yet, as he thought
further, perhaps this was the way his dad would
have wanted it, because he was first and last a spaceman.
Also, his widow would not have to relive the
pain of his loss again. Yes, it probably was best this
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The five of them crossed over on the cable again
and made preparations for transferring the ore to
the <i>Dog Star</i>. They would carry it over in regular
space transfer crates secured to the cable. An empty
crate would be shoved across the gulf, filled up in
the <i>Northern Cross</i>, and then sent back over to be
emptied of its contents.</p>
<p>The crew was split into two parties, five remaining
aboard the <i>Dog Star</i> to unload and the other
six going over to the <i>Northern Cross</i> to load the
treasure aboard the crates.</p>
<p>The work began and moved along smoothly, but
it was going to be a drawn-out operation, if not a
rigorous one. Carrying the containers of ore down
the corridors of the <i>Northern Cross</i> was a simple
matter since they were perfectly weightless and so
had only to be guided along by the touch of a hand.</p>
<p>The hours dragged along slowly as load after load
was drifted down the corridors of the ghost ship
and pushed across the vacuum to the <i>Dog Star</i>. The
storage bins of the smaller ship bulged higher and
higher with the valuable mineral.</p>
<p>As the transference neared completion, Rock
took Shep aside, near one of the ports of the <i>Northern
Cross</i>. Then he began speaking very softly so
that none of Kalmus&rsquo; men working in the ship
could pick up the conversation by helmet radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re nearly through, Shep,&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;and you know what that means for Kalmus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means he&rsquo;s got what he came for and that he
should be satisfied,&rdquo; Shep finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;To me it&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; Rock continued. &ldquo;It
means that he doesn&rsquo;t need any ex-cadets anymore.
You heard him say that Judas could run the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock could barely see the frown on Shep&rsquo;s face
through the filtered facepiece of his helmet. &ldquo;What
are you getting at, Rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fewer men who return to port with the
treasure ore, the fewer there will be to share the
profits,&rdquo; Rock said, his radio-altered voice carrying
a sinister inflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you think that Kalmus is going to
ditch us?&rdquo; Shep asked in a fierce whisper. &ldquo;Right
out here in the middle of space?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I believe that definitely,&rdquo; Rock
corrected, &ldquo;but I do think we should start being on
our guard for any funny moves Kalmus might make.
You&rsquo;ve seen yourself how greedy he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, exactly, do you think we should do?&rdquo;
Shep asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that you, Johnny, Hugh, and myself
should go on over to the <i>Dog Star</i> right now and
tell Kalmus that we believe the ship has got as
much ore as she should carry. That will prevent his
stranding us over here. If he wants to, let him come
over and get the rest of the ore himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re making wild guesses,&rdquo; Shep said,
&ldquo;maybe Kalmus has other plans for dealing with us,
such as making us prisoners on the <i>Dog Star</i> as we
head back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible too,&rdquo; Rock agreed, &ldquo;but he would
need weapons for that, since we outnumber them.
I took a quick look through their things before we
left port to make sure he and his men had no weapons,
and I don&rsquo;t think they brought any along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re being unfair with the guy, suspecting
him at all,&rdquo; Shep said.</p>
<p>As the words left his lips, he happened to glance
out the port and saw Ben Spooner, who had been
working on the <i>Northern Cross</i>, thrust out across
the gulf empty-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look!&rdquo; Shep cried. &ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s in a big hurry
and he&rsquo;s not carrying a crate across!&rdquo; He seized
Rock&rsquo;s space suit. &ldquo;Now there goes Judas right behind
him and he&rsquo;s empty-handed too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock felt his heart take a dive. &ldquo;Shep, they must
be going to do exactly what I feared!&rdquo; He sprang
into action. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ve got to get Hugh and
Johnny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t maroon us in space!&rdquo; Shep said, furious,
as he tagged along behind Rock down the corridor.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not even waiting to carry the rest of the
ore across!&rdquo; Rock said. &ldquo;As soon as we find the fellows,
we&rsquo;ll get over to the <i>Dog Star</i> right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sparky, Ed, and Leo were already in the other
ship. Rock and Shep quickly rounded up Johnny
and Hugh and the four of them hustled toward the
air lock, bumping into crates in their hurry. As
they reached it, Johnny pointed out the open doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Sparky&rsquo;s coming over!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s found out what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Hugh
spoke.</p>
<p>They gave Sparky a hand into the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Sparky?&rdquo; Rock asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Judas told me you wanted help in finishing
up over here and for me to come over,&rdquo; Sparky replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t send for you,&rdquo; Rock told Sparky. &ldquo;It
must be a trick to get the most of us over here.
Come on, you guys! We&rsquo;ll go over and have a show-down
with Kalmus right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before they could launch themselves, Kalmus
had already begun his act of treachery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what those crooks are doing!&rdquo; Shep exclaimed.</p>
<p>The boys could hardly believe what they saw. It
was more like a bad dream. The cable had jerked
away from the side of the <i>Northern Cross</i> as its
magnetic attraction was broken. Then the five saw
Kalmus lean out and pull it into the <i>Dog Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too late!&rdquo; Rock groaned.</p>
<p>The ex-cadets shouted in frustration and anger at
the cold-blooded act. Over their suit radios, they
warned their former partners of the consequences
of abandoning men in space. But even as they
yelled themselves hoarse, Rock knew it wasn&rsquo;t going
to do any good. Kalmus had simply gotten the
jump on them, something that had probably been
planned at the very beginning of the voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>The outer door of the <i>Dog Star</i> closed. A feeling
of utter desperation took possession of Rock. Here
they were, five of them, marooned on a ghost ship
in space, without any foreseeable chance of returning
alive to Earth.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb">An hour had passed since the five ex-cadets had
been cut off from the mother ship. The <i>Dog Star</i>
had blasted off and was now out of sight. Rock
guessed that Kalmus and his rebel crew had compelled
Leo and Ed to assist Jack Judas in running
the ship.</p>
<p>During this time, the castaways had been taking
stock of their situation. Any hopes of sending an
SOS were virtually gone. The radio antenna had
been badly damaged at its base when loosened by
the bulging wall. The radio&rsquo;s present range could
not be over a few thousand miles.</p>
<p>However, things did not look nearly so dark now
as they had earlier. The boys found air tanks that
would sustain them for quite a while, if not indefinitely.
Upon refilling their suits with the aged gas,
they found it breathable but carrying a metallic
odor.</p>
<p>There was a fair abundance of irradiated food
such as all space craft carried. By receiving special
treatment in an electronic oven, such food could
be preserved for years. Although hard and rather
tasteless, the present supply would at least keep
them alive. The water-making machine was still in
good order, and a drink from it was as fresh as if
just drawn from a spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>However satisfactory these three main essentials
were, though, they would all run out some day.
That meant that the <i>Northern Cross</i> would have to
move out of her stagnant orbit if there was any
chance for survival.</p>
<p>Rock was hopefully expectant that the ship
would run again. Save for temperature changes,
there had been no weather erosion to damage the
craft and its fittings. Since the ship&rsquo;s electrical
power came from sunlight and the big solar mirror
had continued to gather light over all these years,
the electric system worked, and the batteries were
still charged. A long-range inspection of the atomic-engine
unit showed no radiation leakage. The unit
had been shut down ever since the accident to the
<i>Northern Cross</i>; the boys found the hafnium safety
rods plunged well home into the atomic pile to
prevent chain reaction. The automatic oil and
grease feeds in the ship&rsquo;s motors had given out by
now, and many bearings were squeaky dry, so they
replenished these.</p>
<p>The boys were now in the pilot&rsquo;s room ready to
try out the ship under its own power. The console
had pretty well resisted the crush of air pressure
that had caused the explosion, for the gauges were
working. But of course working gauges did not necessarily
mean working jets. The boys had made
minor repairs in the main control room. They had
reconciled themselves to living inside space suits
for the rest of the way home since the <i>Northern
Cross</i> was open to the vacuum of space, and the air
lock was too badly damaged to close again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>When everything was in readiness for a test
blast, Rock sat at the console with the others
crowding around him to keep their eyes on the
many dials. The electronic brain and autopilot were
in satisfactory order and would be called upon later
if the ship were able to move under its own thrust.</p>
<p>Rock pressed colored buttons and shoved knife
switches and floor levers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jet chamber pressures are up!&rdquo; Johnny said happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fuel flow gauge is right!&rdquo; Sparky called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coolant is circulating!&rdquo; Hugh reported.</p>
<p>The boys felt a vibration and heard a muted hum.
Then they felt a slight tug. They had already been
traveling at substantial speed under orbital velocity,
but the slight increase was unmistakable. A
check of the dynamometer, that recorded thrust,
indicated that the jets were operating properly.
Rock cut off so that they could make plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could reduce speed and try for landing on
Venus,&rdquo; Rock proposed, looking out the port at
the big planet that was buried within its dense veil,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;d have to be awfully lucky to land within
radio range of any of the research settlements. Besides
our radio being weak, there&rsquo;s a lot of static on
Venus from sunspots.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favor of trying to get back home,&rdquo; Shep
declared. &ldquo;Even if we get off course we may be close
enough to radio Luna or some of the space stations
for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Luna will be right in our
path on the way back,&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<p>Shep&rsquo;s suggestion seemed to be the best idea and
was voted for unanimously. After all had helped in
figuring out the mathematics of their course, Rock
fed the tape into the autopilot. Next everyone took
to shock couches.</p>
<p>The <i>Northern Cross</i> was in the fortunate position
of being headed Earthward, meaning that its orbital
speed could be added to their required velocity.
In a manner of speaking, it was as if Venus were
a slingshot hurling the pebble of the <i>Northern
Cross</i> into space.</p>
<p>Under the crushing pressure of their mounting
acceleration, Rock watched the rising space speed
in his overhead prism with concern. Would the engines
of the ship, inactive for so long, respond at
maximum efficiency? If they did, would the old vessel
hold together under the strain?</p>
<p>The jets responded, at any rate. Rock&rsquo;s body
seemed to be squeezed flat, his eyeballs pressed
deeply into their sockets, his vision blurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Then the ship began leveling off, and the pressure
lifted from Rock&rsquo;s body. Before long it was
gone entirely, and he knew they could unstrap.
The first thing the boys did when they were up was
to check the dials on the console. Everything appeared
to be satisfactory enough; the <i>Northern
Cross</i> should be able to carry them all the way. The
radio was set on automatic SOS. Although extremely
remote, there was the distant possibility
that some ship might be within range.</p>
<p>Later the same day, when Rock had a moment of
relaxation, he located his father&rsquo;s private cabin.
Being among his father&rsquo;s things was almost like
being in his presence and seeing him for the first
time. There were the few neat clothes still hanging
in the closet and the polished black boots in an
orderly row.</p>
<p>On a wall desk he saw a picture of his mother
and a fountain pen lying with the cap off. On the
floor he found a sheet of radiogram paper on which
his father had evidently been writing before the
disaster.</p>
<p>Rock read the letter that his father had intended
to radio to his wife on Earth. The boy&rsquo;s eyes grew
misty and there was a thickening in his throat.</p>
<p>The twenty-year-old message carried a tone of
foreboding. It was as though Dr. Merrill felt that
the four remaining less-experienced men of his
original crew of nineteen could not successfully
bring the ship back to port. &ldquo;So close to my dream
of a satellite hospital and yet so far,&rdquo; were his unhappy
words. &ldquo;And yet we shall try with all our
might, my dear, to come home. This treasure of
ours <i>must</i> not go to waste. There is so much good
that it can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The letter ended abruptly as Dr. Merrill wrote,
&ldquo;Fox has just called me forward. I think they may
be having trouble. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when I
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of course neither Dr. Merrill nor anyone
else ever told what had happened.</p>
<p>Rock tenderly folded the brittle paper and
tucked it away safely. His mother would cherish
this last word from her husband.</p>
<p>Rock knew now why his mother had scrimped
and saved, working at the algae canning plant, to
make him eligible for cadet school. But he didn&rsquo;t
know how hurt she must have been when he
washed out. She hadn&rsquo;t told him that.</p>
<p>The days dragged by slowly. With only a backdrop
of star smudges to look at and unpalatable
meals of hard, ancient food to eat, it was not exactly
an enjoyable trip. Added to this of course were the
youths&rsquo; additional worries about the welfare of
their two buddies and whether the <i>Northern Cross</i>
would hold together until the beloved sphere of
Earth swam into view.</p>
<p>When the ship moved into the environs of Luna,
the weary five knew that Earth could not be far off.
Ninety-nine per cent of their journey was already
over.</p>
<p>Rock studied the enlarging globe of Earth&rsquo;s satellite.
Its wrinkled, gray face shone dazzlingly bright
under the full glare of the sun. The filtering glass
was lowered over the forward port to cut down the
brilliance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>It was on the space day following that there
occurred an incident that filled the boys with exuberant
hope. They were almost at their closest approach
to Luna. The gray desolate lands were right
&ldquo;below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crackling was heard over the automatically set
radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must have picked up our signal and
is trying to make contact!&rdquo; Shep cried out.</p>
<p>Rock moved to the console to begin cutting
speed. Then all gathered around the radio.</p>
<p>Hugh was the radio expert. He scooped up the
mike and slid into the chair in front of the bank of
knobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>SS Northern Cross</i>,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;<i>SS Northern
Cross.</i> Come in, whoever you are! Please come
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crackling continued. Then there was a fragment
of voice that was quickly lost in a babble of
sound.</p>
<p>Hugh kept talking into the mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that faulty antenna!&rdquo; Rock groaned.</p>
<p>The crackling continued. Just as Hugh was about
to give up, a voice came in weakly again. It was a
voice the boys had to strain to hear, but they caught
the vital message: &ldquo;Hugh&mdash;Rock!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;We
picked up your SOS. We&rsquo;ve had to make an emergency
landing on Luna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leo!&rdquo; Shep said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Leo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him quickly if Ed is all right and what their
position is,&rdquo; Rock said to Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re both all right,&rdquo; came Leo&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Our position&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>A rattle of static cut him off. The boys groaned.
It would be impossible to search the moon for a
space ship. They had to get the exact location from
Leo.</p>
<p>They listened hopefully. Hugh kept talking, saying
that they weren&rsquo;t getting clear reception.</p>
<p>Then Leo&rsquo;s distorted voice came through again
briefly. This time he got out the latitude and longitude
of the <i>Dog Star</i>. Rock eagerly wrote it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Kalmus!&rdquo; they heard Leo say next
in a frenzied voice.</p>
<p>That was the last they heard. There followed a
garbled sound and then complete silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus must have destroyed the set,&rdquo; Rock said
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know where to find them now, though,&rdquo;
Shep said with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Rock went to the chart files and dug through the
celestial maps for one of Luna. He checked the
position as given them by Leo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is near Archimedes in Mare Nubium,&rdquo;
Rock pointed out. &ldquo;Get out your pencils
and take a seat at the calculators, boys; we&rsquo;ve got
some navigation figuring to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The velocity and orbital figures were worked out.
Then the directions were computed in the mechanical
brain and fed into the autopilot. The chemical
braking rockets were switched in after the ship had
turned about-face. No terrestrial landing was ever
made with atomic rockets because of radioactive
contamination of the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The boys strapped down and braced for the agony
of deceleration. It was a cumbersome job, clad as
they were in space gear.</p>
<p>As the ship decelerated, Rock focused his hurting
eyes on the prism overhead. The filter cut out
the over-all glare of reflected sunlight from Luna&rsquo;s
boiling-hot surface, but the harsh blacks of dead
shadow and the whites of naked sunlight were still
painfully vivid. He watched the shimmering heat
vapors, the miles and miles of gray pumice, heaped
in waves in some places so that it resembled a gigantic
sea whose motion has been suddenly stilled. Finally
the great curving mouth of Archimedes began
to enlarge and grow in prominence. The crater&rsquo;s
high, rugged walls filled the square of Rock&rsquo;s prism.</p>
<p>Later he felt that easy, reassuring bump of the
tripod fins that told him they had landed safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody O.K.?&rdquo; Rock asked, looking around.</p>
<p>Johnny was pale and the others were a little
groggy (they&rsquo;d had to hit a deceleration of 7 G&rsquo;s in
order to stop the ship in time), but all attested to
being alive, if shaky. Rock went over to the port to
study their surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get off course very much,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;I can make out the <i>Dog Star</i> about a
quarter of a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>In their elevated position, the boys had an extensive
view of the landscape. For miles around, the
ground was dead black. Only in the distance did
the razor-sharp line of sunlight begin. The <i>Northern
Cross</i> was in the broad shadow of Archimedes
and the distant <i>Dog Star</i> was also. Between the
ships lay irregular rock shapes and uneven ground.
A rift sliced across the area, appearing to make contact
between the ships impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Kalmus knows we&rsquo;ve landed?&rdquo; Shep
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Johnny
put in, &ldquo;they are protected by that big ditch. Not to
mention being safely inside the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit we&rsquo;ve got our job cut out for us,&rdquo;
Rock said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think we should try going
back to Earth for help and count on the <i>Dog Star</i>
remaining here to be captured. We might never see
Ed and Leo again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rock is right,&rdquo; Hugh said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to figure
out how to get over to the <i>Dog Star</i> and free the
boys from those crooks as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock got out the pair of binoculars he had found
among the things belonging to the ill-fated crewmen
before them. Then he looked through them at
the distant globe of the <i>Dog Star</i>. The ship had
barely missed a high wall of dark-colored lunabase
rock. The wall was jagged and spongy, like most formations
on Luna, which had so little atmospheric
erosion to wear them down. As he examined the
wall, a sudden idea came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t a couple of us try to get over to that
rock wall next to the <i>Dog Star</i>?&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;We
can climb it and look through some of the ports.
That way we may be able to see what the others are
up to and make our plans accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why just two?&rdquo; Sparky wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less chance of being seen by Kalmus,&rdquo; Rock answered.
&ldquo;Also, if the two get caught, that still
leaves three to think of something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t yet figured how to cross that big
ditch,&rdquo; Hugh pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that too,&rdquo; Rock said. &ldquo;We can
carry along a bunk ladder out of one of the dorms.
From here it looks as if the ladder will span the
ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds risky,&rdquo; Johnny remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something,&rdquo; Shep countered.
&ldquo;I agree with Rock. How about you and me trying
it, Rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was settled. But before anyone could
go outside, the area had to be given time to clear
of residual radioactivity around the atomic rocket
nozzles. After waiting an hour, Rock and Shep got
the ladder and carried it downstairs several flights
to the air lock.</p>
<p>The ladder was tossed through the air lock to the
ground. It floated feather-light. The former cadets
descended by way of the ship&rsquo;s ladder. They carried
a Geiger counter for checking contamination. Besides
the portable ladder, they had with them binoculars,
a safety rope, and a walkie-talkie radio for
communicating with the <i>Northern Cross</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The area was free of contamination. The boys
found walking quite awkward at first and laughed
at their own clumsy efforts as they fairly danced
along through the volcanic and meteoric dust.
There was quite a difference between being absolutely
weightless in magnetic-soled shoes and being
of one-sixth Earth weight without such shoes. They
finally got the hang of it and found they could take
gliding steps of about five feet at a time.</p>
<p>They kept behind rocks and ground rises to minimize
the chance of their being seen. They still could
not be certain Kalmus had not seen the <i>Northern
Cross</i> come down.</p>
<p>The rocks and ground were covered with a down
of hoarfrost. This was due to Luna&rsquo;s scant moisture
content condensing in the exceedingly rare atmosphere
which was made up principally of carbon
dioxide. As they moved along, Rock saw that Shep
was beginning to grow a whitish fuzz of dry ice on
his suit.</p>
<p>It was hard for Rock to realize that the temperature
around them was several hundred degrees
below zero, while only a scant mile or two farther
out it was hotter than boiling water under the full
rays of the sun. This was only one of Luna&rsquo;s many
strange features that fascinated him. He wished this
had been a trip of exploration and fun instead of
the grim battle that it was.</p>
<p>As they approached the great rift in the ground,
Rock began to get a queasy feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wide, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked Shep over his suit radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And deep,&rdquo; Shep replied, after a look over the
brink that had showed no bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>They brought the ladder over to the edge and
carefully spanned the gulf with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just does make it!&rdquo; Rock gasped. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
only about a foot to spare on each end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found a wedge of rock like a dinosaur&rsquo;s
tooth deeply embedded in the ground not far from
the crack. Around this they tied one end of their
safety rope. Then Rock tied the other end around
his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on to the ladder to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t
slip,&rdquo; Rock told his friend, and slowly he started
out over the plunging abyss.</p>
<p>Rock looked down through the rungs at the black
emptiness below. Although he wore the safety line,
a fall could be dangerous. He looked ahead as he
kept moving forward. The other end of the ladder
was wobbling back and forth. When he reached the
opposite side of the brink and climbed onto firm
ground, he was aware only of the perspiration trickling
down his face. It made him turn down his suit
heat a couple of degrees.</p>
<p>He untied the safety line and threw it back to
Shep. Then his friend started over the perilous
bridge, with Rock holding his side of the ladder as
firm as he was able. Shep made it safely too, so they
were both vastly relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just leave the ladder in place,&rdquo; Rock suggested,
then added gravely, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in case we have
to cross it in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Without the ladder to hamper them they could
be more furtive in their movements. They dodged
lithely around towering chunks of light-colored lunarite
and darker lunabase. The rock formations
looked like petrified sponges jutting up out of a
dried-up sea bottom. When the two had to go out
in the open, they sprinted toward the next place of
cover. Since hoarfrost continued to gather on their
suits, they constantly brushed it off. A moving
white figure even in the deep shadows might be
noticed by anyone in the <i>Dog Star</i>.</p>
<p>Now only a few hundred feet separated Rock
and Shep from the space ship. They began swinging
inward nearer the <i>glacis</i> or outer slope of the crater,
heading toward the wall of lunabase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve seen us, they haven&rsquo;t given any sign,&rdquo;
Rock said with some measure of satisfaction when
they had reached the foot of the wall and were
watching the dumbbell shape of the <i>Dog Star</i> just
a short distance away. Standing on its tripod base,
it looked like a huge kettle.</p>
<p>Rock and Shep started up the rugged slope. Although
precipitous and craggy, it did not look to
be too difficult to climb since there were natural
footholds at almost every step. Nevertheless a slip
would be perilous, if not fatal. The boys had been
well drilled in the dire effects of having one&rsquo;s space
suit ripped open. In such case the suit collapsed
like a burst balloon, admitting the killing cold or
heat, whichever it might be, causing death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>When Rock and Shep were at a height level with
the ports of the <i>Dog Star</i>, they began crawling laterally
toward the ship. Rime covered the corallike
edges, making them slippery as the comparative
warmth of their space suits melted the ice particles.
They were about fifty feet from the ship at this
point. Rock checked the counter. There was no
gamma-ray contamination from the <i>Dog Star</i>. It was
safe to approach closer.</p>
<p>They got as close as they dared to the port that
looked in on the main control room. They could see
Leo and Ed working intently on an opened gear-box
beside the instrument console. Across the room
sat Jack Judas, a grim look on his beetle-browed
face. And in his hand the boys could see a blaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did smuggle weapons aboard, Rock!&rdquo; Shep
said. &ldquo;They must have hidden them carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves they planned the scheme from the
very beginning,&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s going to make it harder for us, because
we&rsquo;re unarmed,&rdquo; Shep remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the boys are stalling them,&rdquo; Rock said.
&ldquo;They probably doctored the controls and brought
the ship down just to give us time to catch up with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there were some way to let them know
we&rsquo;ve landed,&rdquo; Shep said. &ldquo;That is, if Kalmus hasn&rsquo;t
found out already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Shep started to move into a better position to
see when suddenly his foothold gave away beneath
him. His cry blasted loudly over Rock&rsquo;s receiver.
Rock made an instinctive grab for his friend. He
barely caught hold of an anchor ring on the other&rsquo;s
space belt in time to keep him from tumbling all
the way to the ground. Rock steadied him as Shep
thrust about with his feet for a new foothold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was a goner!&rdquo; Shep said tremulously.</p>
<p>During the boys&rsquo; struggles they had evidently
released loose material, for they saw a quantity of
the porous stone cascade down the wall and strike
the side of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to scram!&rdquo; Rock said urgently.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bound to have heard that inside! Now
they&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re on Luna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They scrambled downward as fast as possible,
without being reckless. It seemed as if the lunabase
were more slippery than ever. Twice the boys&rsquo;
feet slipped, and only timely bracing by the other
prevented disaster.</p>
<p>When they were about halfway down, Shep&rsquo;s foot
wedged into a crevice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what I had to do with my big feet!&rdquo; Shep
groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Rock said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take them a few
minutes to get space suits on if they have decided
to come out and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock gently but firmly began working on his
friend&rsquo;s imprisoned foot. He moved it back and
forth, tugging and pushing. But it held fast. Even
after several minutes, Shep was still a prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Then suddenly the thing that the boys had feared
happened. The air lock of the <i>Dog Star</i> opened and
a ladder was thrust out until it reached the
ground. Kalmus and two of his companions began
descending. They all carried blasters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re done&mdash;&rdquo; Shep blurted, only to be
shushed abruptly by his friend. Shep had forgotten
that all the suit radios were on the same wave
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree!&rdquo; the
boys heard Ben Spooner say when they were on
the ground. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t anything but some loose
rock that fell off that hill up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocks don&rsquo;t just fall on Luna!&rdquo; Kalmus retorted.
&ldquo;Something has to move them! I still believe those
guys have traced us here! Leo must have been able
to contact them by radio before I could break up
the set!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody around,&rdquo; Mumbly Pegg remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course you don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Kalmus growled.
&ldquo;You dead brain! You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re standing
around waiting to be caught, do you? Start
climbing up that hill, both of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock eased down as flat as he could get and
motioned Shep to do the same. Through his helmet,
Rock could see the grimace of pain on Shep&rsquo;s face
as his movement put pressure on the trapped foot.
Rock cautioned him not to groan or speak a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Over his radio Rock heard Spooner and Pegg
breathing hard as they began scrambling up the
formation, followed by Kalmus. Rock kept perfectly
still, hoping with all his might that the men would
not discover them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think we&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree!&rdquo;
stocky Ben Spooner repeated as his breathing grew
harder at every upward step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up and keep climbing!&rdquo; came Kalmus&rsquo;
voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bound to be up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep was trying manfully to be silent, but every
now and then an involuntary sob of pain escaped
his lips. They could hear Mumbly Pegg murmuring
to himself, in his own peculiar incessant manner.</p>
<p>Now Spooner was getting closer. He was only
about fifteen feet away, and, as if following some
telepathic message, he continued approaching the
youths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for,&rdquo; Rock thought, with despair.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to keep him from finding us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock lowered himself still flatter, until the sharp
edges of lunar stone pressed dangerously into his
inflated suit. Spooner still climbed. Another couple
of feet and he would be looking right down on
them. They heard the sucking of his tired breath
and choking wheezes as if he couldn&rsquo;t take another
step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Rock heard him call weakly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go
any higher! Besides, I can see the top and nobody&rsquo;s
up here! I&rsquo;ve got to come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down then, you weakling!&rdquo; Kalmus
grated. &ldquo;What a bunch of saps I brought along
with me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the top too,&rdquo; came Pegg&rsquo;s voice from
another part of the formation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody up
here, Tony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you guys were right after all,&rdquo; Kalmus
finally conceded.</p>
<p>It seemed a terribly long time before the men
got to the ground and disappeared into the ship.
Rock gave them time to remove their space gear
before daring to speak over his radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s the closest call we&rsquo;ll ever have!&rdquo;
Shep said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still not out of the woods,&rdquo; Rock reminded
him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get you free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went after the trapped foot with a more
determined vengeance. Shep howled, but Rock
finally jerked it free of the stubborn crevice.</p>
<p>When they reached the bottom, Shep was limping
and said his ankle hurt. Rock supported him
and they headed back toward the <i>Northern Cross</i>.
They continued with caution, keeping out of the
open as much as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that we accomplished much,&rdquo; Shep
said wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s given me another plan, at least,&rdquo; Rock replied,
brushing at a new growth of ice crystals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, here we go again!&rdquo; Shep sighed, then
winced as his ankle hurt him again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of us,&rdquo; Rock began, &ldquo;except you&mdash;if you&rsquo;re
not up to it&mdash;will come back over here. We&rsquo;ve already
proved that the trip can be made without
their seeing us. We&rsquo;ll station ourselves around the
air lock, except for one who will climb the formation
and kick rocks down again on the ship. This
time Kalmus will be sure it&rsquo;s us, and they&rsquo;ll come
out to investigate again. When they come out, our
bunch will slip inside. If Judas has been left to
watch Leo and Ed, he shouldn&rsquo;t give us much trouble
by himself if we slip up on him and catch him
unawares. Once we&rsquo;ve locked out the other three
they&rsquo;ll give in willingly just to get back inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty daring,&rdquo; Shep said doubtfully,
&ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ve got to be daring if we&rsquo;re going
to save the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked, Rock radioed the <i>Northern
Cross</i> with the walkie-talkie he&rsquo;d been carrying on
his back, telling the boys of their close call.</p>
<p>When the two reached the ladder bridge across
the rift, Shep had difficulty crossing with his injured
foot. He went first, and as Rock steadied the
frail bridge, he held his breath tensely for fear
Shep would slip. They had used the safety rope
again, but, if one of them should fall, he could easily
rip open his suit as he thudded against the jagged
side of the chasm.</p>
<p>Once more, however, they got across without
mishap and were soon back at the ship. The boys
helped them in eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fellows ready to go back with me?&rdquo;
Rock asked them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>They looked at him in amazement. He explained
his new plan to them. All considered it taking a big
chance, but, not being able to think of anything
better, they agreed that they might as well try it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus is getting mean and nasty,&rdquo; Shep told
them. &ldquo;This thing seems to be getting on his
nerves. There&rsquo;s no telling what he&rsquo;ll do to the boys
before this is all over. He and his men have blasters,
and they mean business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys prepared a snack for themselves, then
began to dress, trying to choose the best of the antiquated
suits.</p>
<p>Shep did not suit up. He said that he wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to help any because of his ankle, which was
noticeably swollen now. He wouldn&rsquo;t let any of
the others stay behind with him, however.</p>
<p>When all were dressed and ready to go, they said
good-by to their crippled buddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do if you don&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo; Shep
asked Rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll just have to come over and join
us,&rdquo; Rock replied, half-jokingly. &ldquo;Two could possibly
get the ship back to port in a pinch but not
one man alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll prefer your coming back,&rdquo; Shep
said, with a broad grin. &ldquo;Good luck, you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four of them started out. Rock showed his
friends the route he and Shep had taken before,
one that appeared safe from possible inquiring
eyes aboard the <i>Dog Star</i>. It took them some time
to cross the chasm, since each fellow had to tie on
the safety rope as he went over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb the lunabase formation,&rdquo; Rock told
them, &ldquo;because I was up there before and know
the way. The rest of you keep away from the ports
and sneak up to the air lock over there. When I see
that you&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;ll kick some stone down onto
the ship. That should bring them outside in a few
minutes. We&rsquo;ve already made our plans from then
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock watched Hugh, Sparky, and Johnny slip
agilely into the open and bound like gazelles over
to the air lock. Then he started to climb the wall as
he and Shep had done before.</p>
<p>It was then that the shocking collapse of Rock&rsquo;s
bold plan came about.</p>
<p>Kalmus and all three of his men darted swiftly
from behind the ship, two on each side. They leveled
their blasters at the boys, warning them to
stay in their tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them covered, Ben,&rdquo; Kalmus ordered.
&ldquo;Come on, Jack and Mumbly. There&rsquo;s another one
around here somewhere. I saw four of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shocking suddenness of the countermove
had left Rock numb and immobile for a few seconds.
But he quickly regained his composure and
sprang into action. He leaped to the ground and
scrambled madly to safety behind the lunabase formation.</p>
<p>He had barely ducked behind a monolith before
two helmeted heads loomed some twenty feet away.
A glance in the other direction showed him the
third. He had to get out of there quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>He dashed into the open and with great leaps
tried to put as much distance between himself and
his pursuers as he could. He got a good start on
them before they caught sight of him and gave
chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Kalmus roared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shoot if you
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock kept running, heading for the chasm. If
the three were shooting at him, he had no way of
telling in the near airlessness of the planet. He
wouldn&rsquo;t know unless he felt the hot stab of a heat
ray and the explosive loss of air from his suit.</p>
<p>Reaching the rift, he cast a hurried glance behind
and saw the three still following. Not having
time to tie on the safety rope, Rock started across
the chasm.</p>
<p>Over his radio he continued to hear Kalmus&rsquo;
threats. The voice grew louder as the pursuers drew
close. Being able to move ten feet or so at a jump,
it wouldn&rsquo;t take them many seconds to reach the
chasm.</p>
<p>Rock clutched at the far bank and hauled himself
onto safe ground. As he exhaustedly pulled the
ladder across out of reach of the others, he looked
up to see them almost at the edge. But without the
ladder, they were helpless to advance any farther.</p>
<p>Fearing a well-placed shot, Rock scrambled for
cover behind a protective clump of boulders not
far off. Only then did he feel that he could dare
take a deep breath since the terrible ordeal had begun.
Kalmus and his two companions seemed reluctant
to attempt a jump of the chasm and headed
back to the <i>Dog Star</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>Almost exhausted, he pulled the ladder across and
out of their reach.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Rock continued on to the <i>Northern Cross</i>.</p>
<p>When Shep admitted him into the ship, Rock
related the unhappy story with bitter tears in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys should have set me adrift long ago!&rdquo;
Rock burst out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been giving orders ever since
we started, and every plan has backfired! Now there
are only the two of us left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to have a leader,&rdquo; Shep said more
calmly. &ldquo;We chose you because we thought you
were the best. We still do. Now quit feeling sorry
for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what could have happened!&rdquo; Rock
sighed, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know,&rdquo; Shep said. &ldquo;Kalmus just happened to
see you fellows coming, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock sat down wearily. &ldquo;You take over from
here, Shep. I&rsquo;m licked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep could see that his friend was genuinely distressed.
He concealed the harrowing pain he felt in
his ankle and tried to think of their next move.
Minutes passed without Rock speaking. He merely
stared out the port at the star-jeweled sky and the
shimmering ball of Earth that could look so close
to a person in space and yet be so far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that two could run this ship in a
pinch,&rdquo; Shep spoke to break the silence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
just have to take the <i>Northern Cross</i> back to port
ourselves and get help from the Space Guard. The
boys will probably try to stall longer and keep the
<i>Dog Star</i> on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that is the only way,&rdquo; Rock admitted,
then added dismally, &ldquo;If the ship isn&rsquo;t here when
the Guard comes back, we probably won&rsquo;t see the
fellows anymore, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you need is a good rest, Rock,&rdquo; Shep told
him. &ldquo;None of us has had one since we came here.
Let&rsquo;s get a few hours of sleep, one at a time, and
then get back to the problem when we&rsquo;re more refreshed.
I&rsquo;ll stand first watch to see if the <i>Dog Star</i>
takes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pretty tired,&rdquo; Rock said. &ldquo;This time we&rsquo;ll
do what you say, Shep,&rdquo; he smiled feebly. &ldquo;You be
sure to wake me to relieve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock stretched out in a chair and fell asleep
almost immediately.</p>
<p>The next thing he remembered was his friend
shaking him. Rock stirred sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be shot for going to sleep on guard
duty,&rdquo; Shep confessed. &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t help it,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock had no reason to doubt that the <i>Dog Star</i>
would not still be in its same spot, but some impulse
prompted him to look out the port just the
same. His heart suddenly seemed to go dead inside
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship is gone, Shep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glasses revealed indisputably that the ship
had blasted off. There was only a blackened ring and
a depression where the <i>Dog Star</i> had been before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gotten the jump on us again!&rdquo; Rock
said brokenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus must have threatened the boys, or else
Judas got the ship off,&rdquo; Shep said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it was, they&rsquo;re gone now,&rdquo; Rock said
hopelessly. &ldquo;They can be heading for almost any
place in the solar system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do now?&rdquo; Shep
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead with our same plan to notify the
Guard, I guess,&rdquo; Rock replied tonelessly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
probably send out some cruisers to look for the <i>Dog
Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock stared solemnly out the port. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault
all this has happened. My fault that we ever started
out on this crazy treasure hunt and my fault that
the boys are in the hands of these space pirates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself, Rock. The fellows knew
very well what they were getting into. It&rsquo;s not your
fault that things haven&rsquo;t worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock tried to shake off the pall of despair that
had dogged him for the past few hours and got busily
to work. &ldquo;Well, no use just sitting here on Luna
talking about it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get that
ankle of yours bandaged and then we&rsquo;ll start up the
engines.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>It was going to be a tricky undertaking to manage
all the complicated controls between the two of
them. Shep was further hindered by his ankle that
had stiffened while he had slept. Rock had remembered
seeing a first-aid kit and he went for it. He
wrapped the ankle tightly so that Shep would be
able to get about with a minimum of pain. They had
to cut the sides of Shep&rsquo;s magnetic-soled shoe so that
there would be as little discomfort as possible. Shep
could have done without magnetic shoes altogether,
being content to float about weightlessly in the
ship when they were beyond Luna&rsquo;s gravity pull,
but this would have interfered with running the
ship, which required a certain amount of body leverage.</p>
<p>The two got their individual duties synchronized
so that there would be no hitch, Rock taking the
bulk of the work.</p>
<p>They calculated their figures and prepared the
tape for the autopilot. Then they strapped down in
the couch room for the take-off. Rock still did not
trust the <i>Northern Cross</i> too far, and at this moment
he was concerned lest the old ship might not
respond to the lift of her jets. The next few moments
would tell the story.</p>
<p>Rock felt the vibration of the ship as the fuel
pumps went to work. The overhead prism showed
the flow meter registering properly, but the big
question was still whether the ship would be able
to lift itself into the heights. Then a sudden movement
seemed to cut Rock&rsquo;s breath off in his throat.
His body pressed deeply into his couch, aching, but
Rock was glad. The ship was rising from the soil of
Luna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>They pushed the <i>Northern Cross</i> along at the
top speed they believed was reasonably safe. The
ship creaked and groaned under the burden of
maximum thrust. As yet she had given no indication
of suffering worse than this, but it was clear
that the space vessel had seen her best days.</p>
<p>When the <i>Northern Cross</i> was about two-thirds
of the way home, a suspicious dot was seen on the
radarscope, moving too slowly for a meteor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shep!&rdquo; Rock called. &ldquo;Take a look at this, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep limped over as Rock got out his binoculars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Rock blurted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Dog
Star</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Shep cried, and grabbed the binoculars
from Rock. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> the <i>Dog Star</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus has got more nerve than I thought he
had!&rdquo; Rock said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d risk heading
straight for Earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever the reason, we&rsquo;ve got him in our
sights,&rdquo; Shep said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow him in, I guess,&rdquo; Rock answered. &ldquo;Whatever
station he heads for, we&rsquo;ll put the Guard right
on him and his cronies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise our keeping our distance so we won&rsquo;t
scare him off,&rdquo; Shep suggested.</p>
<p>Rock nodded. &ldquo;When we get closer in, we may
be able to radio a warning to the stations to be
on the lookout for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>They followed the <i>Dog Star</i> for an entire space
day, keeping the same distance between the ships.
The craft was undoubtedly still heading for Earth
and its company of artificial satellites. If her occupants
had spotted the other ship, they did not seem
alarmed. Kalmus appeared to be walking right into
capture at a time when victory seemed to be completely
his. It didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Hours later, Rock was interrupted from study of
a sky chart when Shep cried out in an anguished
voice. Rock dashed over to the port where his
friend was looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been an explosion aboard the <i>Dog
Star</i>!&rdquo; Shep blurted. &ldquo;A big burst of flame poured
out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get to her right away!&rdquo; Rock said
hoarsely.</p>
<p>It took some time to change course and swing
around in pursuit of the <i>Dog Star</i>&rsquo;s new glide path.
Rock fretted impatiently. He had nightmare visions
of what might have happened or might now
be happening to his buddies aboard the stricken
vessel.</p>
<p>As soon as the <i>Northern Cross</i> had matched flight
paths with the other craft, Rock reduced their velocity
so they could creep up on the <i>Dog Star</i> &ldquo;overhead.&rdquo;
The maneuver was accomplished as quickly
as possible. The <i>Northern Cross</i> now lay &ldquo;above&rdquo;
the <i>Dog Star</i>, with a space of about a hundred feet
between.</p>
<p>Rock set the controls on hold positions as Shep
procured a long towline. The boys dressed hurriedly
in space gear, then opened the air lock closest to
the ragged topside hole they had seen in the other
ship. They secured the safety line to an outside
anchor ring, then Rock fastened the line to his
own suit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better stay out of this with that
bad ankle of yours,&rdquo; Rock told Shep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let you go across on your own?&rdquo; Shep
retorted. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sticking with you this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rock shoved off briskly from the ship&rsquo;s hull and
floated across the gulf of vacuum toward the <i>Dog
Star</i>. He landed on the hull not far from the explosion
hole that was amidships near a rocket-tube
cluster. Shep pulled in the line and then launched
himself across the emptiness. Rock steadied him as
he landed.</p>
<p>The two scrambled immediately down through
the gaping cavity, careful not to snag their suits on
the sharp edges. The boys climbed down along the
bulkheads of the corridor where smoke swirled like
fog.</p>
<p>Reaching the floor, they were met by four running
figures in space suits. The boys recognized
Kalmus and his three companions in a desperate
hurry.</p>
<p>Rock lashed out boldly at Kalmus who was rushing
at him. He heard the big fellow groan over his
suit radio as the blow landed. But then Rock was
charged by Jack Judas. He was lifted off the floor
and, because of his helplessness when not in contact
with it, was sent crashing heavily against the wall
of the corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Rock scrambled down off the wall to resume the
battle. Shep was courageously taking on all four of
their attackers. Rock leaped into the middle of it
all, swinging fiercely. Another blow sent him careening
into the wall. Shep was flat on the floor
now.</p>
<p>Expecting no mercy from the victors, Rock was
amazed to see the four withdraw from the fight and
run off down the corridor in the direction they had
been heading in before. Rock and Shep tiredly
climbed to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t after us!&rdquo; Shep gasped. &ldquo;They were
just trying to get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re heading for the lifeboat rockets, I
guess,&rdquo; Rock panted. &ldquo;They looked scared to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the fellows!&rdquo; Shep said.</p>
<p>They hurried along to the main control room.
It was empty, so they moved farther along to the
navigation room. The door was locked and from inside
there came the sound of beating fists. With
their heavy space boots Rock and Shep began kicking
the light metal door with passionate vigor. Finally
they tore the lock loose and the twisted door
swung inward.</p>
<p>Sparky, Ed, and Johnny were sagging against the
far wall, their eyelids half-closed. Leo was giggling
strangely and chattering as if enjoying himself.
Sparky kept crying out, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Hugh appeared normal. It was he who had
been beating on the door. His face was red with
fright and shiny with sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air pressure is down!&rdquo; Hugh gasped to Rock
and Shep. &ldquo;Give us air!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Rock and Shep slammed the door to save as
much remaining air as possible and hurried to the
supply room. They gathered up all the oxygen bottles
that they could carry and rushed back with
them. They opened the petcocks on all, and the life-giving
precious gas began flooding the room.</p>
<p>But the gauge on the wall still showed a subnormal
air pressure. Shep and Rock found space suits
in the supply room and began helping their companions
into them. The victims could help a little,
but, except for Hugh, they were still in such a state
of anoxia that their rescuers had to do most of the
work.</p>
<p>Finally the five were safely encased in suits, with
clean pressurized air filling their lungs.</p>
<p>When the others felt like it, they began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus had us locked up in the navigation
room while they went to eat,&rdquo; Hugh explained.
&ldquo;Then when the explosion came, Kalmus and his
men must have been in such a hurry that they forgot
all about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might know that the only thing that would
have made Kalmus abandon the treasure would be
the saving of his own neck,&rdquo; Rock said contemptuously.
&ldquo;You fellows had better get a physical as
soon as we get to port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep asked the fellows what had happened since
their capture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus made us blast off soon after he caught
us,&rdquo; Hugh was the first to reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made Kalmus head for Earth?&rdquo; Rock
asked. &ldquo;We thought that would be the last place
he&rsquo;d want to carry all of you since you&rsquo;d be able to
incriminate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus didn&rsquo;t intend to land at a space station!&rdquo;
Ed cut in. &ldquo;He was going straight for Earth
and touch down in the Arizona desert where he
could unload the ore without being noticed. Then
he and the others were going to sell it a little at a
time over a long period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry the <i>Dog Star</i> directly to Earth!&rdquo; Shep exclaimed.
&ldquo;This ship isn&rsquo;t made for atmospheric
travel! It would have been turned into a meteor by
skin friction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we tried to tell that crazy man!&rdquo;
Sparky said. &ldquo;But he thought we were trying to fool
him and get him to dock at one of the space stations.
Judas knew the danger too, but Kalmus wouldn&rsquo;t
listen to him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you keep the <i>Dog Star</i> at such slow
velocity?&rdquo; Rock asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shorted out the circuit to a couple of jets,&rdquo;
Johnny replied. &ldquo;Told Kalmus it was an accident.
We had Judas fooled too. We were trying to stall
reaching Earth as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hoped we&rsquo;d get a chance to jump the fellows,&rdquo;
Hugh put in. &ldquo;We even had an outside hope
that you might catch up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Rock went back to the earlier capture of Leo and
Ed. Kalmus wanted only two of the boys to run the
ship, Leo explained, so that they could be easily
watched by the four. That was why they had sent
Sparky back over after the transfer of the ore.</p>
<p>Ed said that he and Leo had made such an unsatisfactory
job (intentionally) of running the ship
that Kalmus had made Judas take over. But Judas
was so rusty with his piloting that he botched up
the controls, making a forced landing on Luna necessary.
The boys then got the idea of trying to contact
the <i>Northern Cross</i> by radio, which they had done
in one of Kalmus&rsquo; unguarded moments. Kalmus had
been so infuriated to discover this that he had destroyed
the radio. He mistakenly thought he had
done it before a message had been sent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ve seen the last of that Kalmus
bunch,&rdquo; Shep declared. &ldquo;If everything turns out all
right for us, I don&rsquo;t care whether they are ever
caught or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they got off in the lifeboats?&rdquo;
Hugh suddenly asked.</p>
<p>During their discussion of past events, they had
almost forgotten about the present whereabouts of
Kalmus and his men. They went to check the escape
hatches and found one of four lifeboat rockets gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they expect to reach any of the
space stations with their limited knowledge of navigation,&rdquo;
Sparky said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even Judas can find his way home from here,&rdquo;
Rock told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only a few thousand miles
from the outer radio relay satellite. The lifeboats
have simple instructions printed on the walls that
practically anybody can follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shep changed the subject. &ldquo;Anybody know what
caused the explosion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a valve lock somewhere in the chemical
fuel system,&rdquo; Hugh answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what all
of us think, judging from the sound of the blast.
Our tinkering with the jets might have caused it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing to do now,&rdquo; Rock said, &ldquo;is to get these
ships back to port, that is, if the <i>Dog Star</i> has still
got its power. I suggest we split into two groups,
four on the <i>Northern Cross</i> and three on the <i>Dog
Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was discovered that the damage from the explosion
would prevent the <i>Dog Star</i> from traveling
at its best speed because one entire rocket section
was out of order. But it would run.</p>
<p>They drew lots to see who would ride in which
vessel. Rock, Hugh, Ed, and Shep drew the <i>Northern
Cross</i> and Leo, Sparky, and Johnny the <i>Dog
Star</i>.</p>
<p>Rock and his three companions who would return
to the <i>Northern Cross</i> went back to the ship
by way of the towline. The ghost ship still hovered
overhead in the same position it had occupied
before, even though the two craft were traveling at
a good pace through the deeps.</p>
<p>The space ships were brought back into their
original Earthward paths, and in a few hours&rsquo; time
the braking rockets were ready to cut in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Several futile attempts had been made to contact
a space station by radio, and it wasn&rsquo;t until this
point that the <i>Northern Cross</i> was able to establish
its first contact over the crippled set. This was
by way of a continuous signal beamed out through
space by a rotating antenna atop the outermost artificial
satellite, the radio relay station, 50,000 miles
from Earth.</p>
<p>Hugh signaled for an operator and when he
came in, Hugh gave the name of the ship and its
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you say you were?&rdquo; Rock heard the
operator ask in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Northern Cross</i>,&rdquo; Hugh answered, &ldquo;serial
number A45-J, World Spacecraft, manufacturer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end for several
moments. Hugh winked at Rock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some
fun with them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the ship go out?&rdquo; the operator asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago,&rdquo; Hugh replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a joke?&rdquo; the other retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Hugh assured him.</p>
<p>The radioman chose not to argue any further.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you approach instructions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two ships,&rdquo; Hugh told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator sputtered again when Hugh told
him that the <i>Dog Star&rsquo;s</i> radio was completely out.
&ldquo;How do you expect me to bring a ship in without
a radio?&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you give us both instructions,&rdquo; Hugh answered,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll relay those for the other ship to
them by suit radio. We&rsquo;re close enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know this is highly irregular,&rdquo; the
operator replied. &ldquo;I still think you&rsquo;re pulling my
leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the approach instructions were given, Rock
relayed them to the <i>Dog Star</i>. The connection was
rather feeble because of the low power of Rock&rsquo;s
suit radio transmitter, but by hooking up his own
suit radio to the ship&rsquo;s antenna, damaged though
it was, Leo, acting as radioman, could hear well
enough.</p>
<p>As the ships moved in parallel to the spinning
station, a final adjustment by the forward jets synchronized
the ships&rsquo; motion with that of the rotating
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good approach,&rdquo; the operator admitted
grudgingly. &ldquo;You two will come into adjoining
Docks 5 and 6. Stand by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently two sets of long, flexible metal arms
reached out from the space station like the arms
of an octopus and attached themselves magnetically
to the sides of the ships. Then slowly the <i>Northern
Cross</i> and <i>Dog Star</i> were pulled into their docks.</p>
<p>Word of arrival of the derelict space ship had
been spreading all over the station apparently, for
Rock and his friends found the entire high brass
there to meet them as they crossed through the
coupling tubes into the satellite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>The boys were conducted to the official quarters
of the commanding officer where he was gathered
with the other members of his staff. There Rock
related the entire story of their trip. At first mention
of Kalmus&rsquo; name, Colonel George had spoken
to one of his officers and sent him out.</p>
<p>When Rock was through with his story, Colonel
George shook his balding gray head, although it
was a gesture not without humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a fiction piece, Merrill,&rdquo; the officer
said, his eyes glowing with an excitement that
suggested he might have enjoyed sharing such an
adventure himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I disbelieve you! I don&rsquo;t mean that.
It&rsquo;s just so incredible what a group of young fellows
have done!&rdquo; He looked at his spellbound officers
and they nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent one of my men to see if Kalmus had
docked here,&rdquo; Colonel George went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
probably a scoundrel with a bad record. That must
have been why he was in such a hurry to get started
from the servicing station, before his references
could be checked at central identification on Earth.
You mentioned, Merrill, that he appeared very generous
in extending credit to you. I suppose you
realize now that he must have planned to take over
the ship from the very beginning and therefore
his original so-called credit would be only a fraction
of the wealth he expected to bring back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we finally guessed that, sir,&rdquo; Rock said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>There was a wait until the officer returned with
the facts on Kalmus. He handed a yellow sheet to
the commanding officer who read it with a show
of regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kalmus and his men docked here about two
hours ago,&rdquo; Colonel George said. &ldquo;As soon as they
docked, they immediately jumped on a ferry going
Earthward. The ferry landed some time ago and
they can be anywhere on Earth. I&rsquo;m afraid Kalmus
and party have given us the slip. We&rsquo;ve already
notified the authorities to initiate a search for them.
Too bad you men were unable to get in touch with
us by radio so that we could have been ready for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have escaped, sir,&rdquo; Rock reminded
him, &ldquo;but not with the ore treasure, not even his
own half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel George chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And if
he should turn up to claim it, we&rsquo;ll charge him
with a crime that is quite serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he and his men are ever captured, sir,&rdquo; Rock
said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a settlement with him then. He
may need the money for some good lawyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel smiled. &ldquo;I see you fellows want to
do the right thing even if he hasn&rsquo;t. Let me say
here that I consider what you men have done,
bringing into port two crippled ships, the most
remarkable space performance I have ever heard
about in my career. I&rsquo;d have given anything to be
thirty years younger and one of you!&rdquo; He sighed
regretfully. &ldquo;In view of all this, I believe it would
be embarrassing to the Space Academy not to reconsider
you seven for cadet school. I&rsquo;ll personally
make a strong recommendation for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>The boys, except for their leader, were profuse
in their thanks. Rock was quietly grateful and
filled with a heart-warming satisfaction. For all
these long weeks since their blast-off, he had suffered
remorse for having brought his friends into
such perils as they faced. Now it had all worked out
for a purpose. Where they might never have come
back, now they had not only returned without
harm, but they would reclaim the opportunity for
a space career that had appeared to end for them
with their washout from the Space Academy.</p>
<p>As Rock happily thought over these things, an
officer wearing the insigne of a metallurgist came
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made an assay of the ore cargo on the
<i>Northern Cross</i>, Colonel,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good
alconite ore and is worth a fortune, and of course
the ship is quite valuable too. It&rsquo;ll tell us a lot
about long-period effects of space conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my success is complete,&rdquo; Rock thought.
&ldquo;Dad did not lose his life for nothing. The satellite
hospital will be a living memorial to his unselfish
ambition. Even with all the things that happened
to us, I&rsquo;m glad we took the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sure his friends felt the same way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c9"><br />SPACE STEWARD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Carry your bags, sir?&rdquo; The gentleman tourist
in the space harbor looked at the youth who had
stepped out of the night. Although the boy&rsquo;s clothes
weren&rsquo;t as fine, perhaps, as those of the other baggage
carriers, there was something about him
which appealed to the man. The boy had a wiry,
athletic build, and his gray, sincere eyes shone
with spirit and good nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, son,&rdquo; the big, white-thatched man said,
smiling. &ldquo;Suite 8, &lsquo;B&rsquo; Deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;B&rsquo; Deck!&rdquo; Jim Vance echoed. &ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hoisted the bags easily in his strong arms.
Then, handing his patron one half of a baggage
check, he headed briskly for the concrete pit where
the throbbing space ship rested on torpedolike tail
fins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Jim was in a tingle of excitement. This was his
first customer on &lsquo;B&rsquo; Deck. He&rsquo;d get a first-rate
view of the <i>Hercules&rsquo;</i> luxury quarters! Jim always
swallowed hard when he neared the astronaut. She
was so incredibly big, so very much like the massiveness
of the space which was her real home.
Though the <i>Hercules</i> was carrying some space
freight this trip, she was mainly a tourist vessel;
and her destination was Venus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything if I could make one trip into
deep space,&rdquo; he thought fervently as he stepped
into the outside elevator and was carried far above
the brightly lighted Miami spaceport. For an instant
he seemed to share a kinship with the silent
stars that encircled him like a speckled bowl.</p>
<p>Getting off on B Deck, Jim walked slowly along
the polished corridor toward Suite 8. The finery of
the deck fairly numbed his senses. While studying
the turquoise carpet underfoot, his eyes shifted to
his worn shoes, and then he felt out of place.</p>
<p>It took money to go into space. If not that, it at
least took extensive training to be a crewman. He
had neither money nor training, not even a family.
Not that Jim Vance was ready to cry about it,
though. He had long ago accepted his lot without
complaint.</p>
<p>A senior-grade lieutenant stopped him outside of
Suite 8. He wore a square red mustache, and he
neatly filled a uniform of gray flannel with gold piping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re blasting off at 0800 sharp, son,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Better remind your patron to get aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; Jim returned. For a moment he felt
like a full-fledged crewman taking orders. He liked
the feel of it, and he wished desperately that it
were so.</p>
<p>He went into the suite and set down the bags.
His eyes roved over the rich trimmings, the deep
honeycomb rubber cushions. An oval port looked
out on the winking night lights of the coast city.
There were two other rooms to the luxury quarters.</p>
<p>The hideaway degravity cot in the main compartment
had already been pulled down out of the wall
by a steward, but its front clamps were not yet
snapped to the floor. Jim closed the light beryllium
door of the compartment and tried out the cot. He
sank down into its cloudlike softness. As he lay
there dreaming of worlds beyond Earth, suddenly
the front end of the cot swung upward. In trying to
scramble out before he was closed up in the wall,
he was sent spinning into the air by the powerful
spring action of the cot. His head cracked solidly
against the metal wall, and he saw more stars than
there were in the night.</p>
<p>He lay in a daze for some time, stupefied, not
realizing the passing of time. What finally roused
him was the sensation of vibrating like a milk shake
in a mixer. The floor beneath him throbbed like the
surface of the Atlantic Ocean just beyond. Jim
didn&rsquo;t have to be a spaceman to know that the <i>Hercules</i>
was about to blast off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Cold sweat flowed over him as he realized he
could not leave the ship in time. The only thing he
could do was prepare himself for the shock of the
blast-off. He yanked down the degravity cot again,
making certain this time that it was clamped to the
floor. He guessed that all he had to do was recline
on the cot as he had before and strap himself down
with the black leather bands and plastic buckles.</p>
<p>He had scarcely done this before the pit of his
stomach seemed to dive into his shoes, and he felt
that exhilarating &ldquo;first minute of acceleration&rdquo; he
had read so much about. When this was over, he
knew the <i>Hercules</i> had climbed above the bulk of
Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and was leveling off on a horizontal
curve from the planet&rsquo;s surface. The rotation
of the Earth would give the spaceship a final boost
into the deeps.</p>
<p>When Jim&rsquo;s stomach quieted, he unbuckled and
attempted to get to his feet. The motion sent him
flying up into the air! It then struck him that he
had forgotten about the weightlessness of space.
Some ships had artificial gravity in them; but because
the <i>Hercules</i> was chiefly a pleasure ship, the
tourists preferred to &ldquo;rough it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim became almost panicky in his efforts to
right himself. His forehead grew hot although the
cool atmosphere of the compartment was comfortable.
He guessed that it wasn&rsquo;t entirely the shock of
no gravity that was making him sweat. He was
thinking about his unpaid passage on the <i>Hercules</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stowaway,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sent to
jail for this.&rdquo; He had read about the severe penalty
for trying to hitch a ride on a space vessel. This was
because weight was critical, and the addition of just
a few extra pounds could prevent the rocket fuel
from pushing the ship to its distant port, could
even cause disaster.</p>
<p>Jim felt his head where he had taken the near
knockout blow. There was only a small bump. Who
would ever believe his story of what had really happened?
Besides, he&rsquo;d had no business trying out the
degravity cot.</p>
<p>While he was pondering what he should do,
there was a rap on the door of the suite. Jim slunk
against the far wall, dreading to be found out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Mr. Bowers?&rdquo; came a deep
voice.</p>
<p>Jim opened his mouth to reply but only a wordless
croak came out. The door swung open, and a
husky steward with a young face &ldquo;swam&rdquo; in. At
sight of Jim a surprised look crossed his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he blurted.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Bowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim felt as though he were in a crazy dream.
The steward was floating toward him like a phantom
in a nightmare, while he himself was like a desperate
fish without fins in this strange sea of
weightlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Mr. Bowers,&rdquo; Jim managed to
reply, then went on to explain what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The steward looked at him skeptically, his round
face attempting to judge him. &ldquo;Is this the truth?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Jim nodded and showed the bump on his head.
Then he waited tensely for the verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I believe you,&rdquo; the steward said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Jim returned. He quickly decided
that he liked the young steward with the surprisingly
deep voice.</p>
<p>The steward looked thoughtful. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
figure out a way to keep you from being discovered
until we return to Earth. That way, you&rsquo;ll have had
time to help out and pay your way. It&rsquo;ll go easier
with you when you turn yourself in.&rdquo; Then he
frowned. &ldquo;What about your family, though? They&rsquo;ll
surely be worried about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a family,&rdquo; Jim told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an
orphan, and I&rsquo;ve been on my own for two years.
Don&rsquo;t you think I ought to make a clean breast of
everything to the captain now and hope he&rsquo;ll believe
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward shook his head emphatically. &ldquo;Not
<i>this</i> captain. Not Captain Coppard. He&rsquo;s a stickler
for regulations. He&rsquo;d never believe your story. If
he does find out, you&rsquo;ll be on prison rations for the
rest of the trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do, then?&rdquo; Jim asked, suddenly feeling
very dependent on the young man he faced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>The steward&rsquo;s forehead creased in a frown. &ldquo;The
captain doesn&rsquo;t know the steward crew too well
because there were some last-minute substitutions.
I think you&rsquo;d do best to become a steward and work
out your passage that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A steward on a space ship! The idea of it thrilled
Jim so much that he almost forgot the seriousness
of his situation. He wondered how he&rsquo;d look in the
neat starched white that the steward in front of
him wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I think we ought to get acquainted,&rdquo; his
new friend said. He extended a workingman&rsquo;s
strong grip, and Jim took it. &ldquo;My name is Al Hogan.
Everybody calls me &lsquo;Babe&rsquo; because of my face.&rdquo;
He grinned boyishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jim Vance,&rdquo; Jim said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a good steward, Jim,&rdquo; Babe declared.
&ldquo;My job depends on being able to spot good
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m chief steward in charge of personnel aboard
the <i>Hercules</i>,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for
you that I saw you first. I can hire you without
your having to see anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing in my favor,&rdquo; Jim said with
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s one more strike against you,
though, Jim,&rdquo; Babe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve &lsquo;bumped&rsquo; the most important man in
the space tourist business, and that isn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this suite was Mr. Bowers&rsquo;, the owner of
Venus Space Tours, Incorporated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come aboard in time for the
blast-off?&rdquo; Jim wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bowers depends on the stewards to let him
know just ahead of time because he usually has a
lot of last-minute things to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know who he was!&rdquo; Jim said.
&ldquo;Wow, what a mistake to make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for the <i>Hercules</i>, though,&rdquo; Babe remarked,
&ldquo;your weight has canceled out his. There&rsquo;s
another rub, though. Mr. Bowers may have the Miami
port radio us that you&rsquo;re aboard. That would
expose you for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim had an idea that his career as a spaceman was
going to be extremely brief.</p>
<p>Babe showed him how to navigate in the state of
no gravity. By kicking out rearward, he could shoot
himself along almost as smoothly as a fish in water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; Babe said, &ldquo;and let&rsquo;s get you
started as a steward. You can bunk in my extra cot.
There was an odd number of men this trip, leaving
the spare bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe locked the door of Mr. Bowers&rsquo; suite so
that no one would be curious about him. He told
Jim that Mr. Bowers very rarely mixed with the
passengers or crew. For this reason he would not
likely be missed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Babe kept Jim out of sight of the other crewmen
and hurriedly got him fitted into a steward&rsquo;s white
uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your job will be to show the tourists how to get
along in the space ship,&rdquo; Babe told him.</p>
<p>Jim went around with Babe to learn the ropes.
Some of the steward&rsquo;s friends looked at Jim curiously
and asked about him. Babe satisfied them by
saying that Jim was a last-minute addition.</p>
<p>The first jobs Jim and Babe had to take care of
were several cases of space sickness. Lack of gravity
did funny things to the balancing mechanism in the
ear and often made amateur space travelers feel as
though they were coming apart. A dose of medicine
usually fixed them up. Jim was glad that he himself
did not suffer from this affliction.</p>
<p>Jim watched Babe instruct a gentleman how to
take a nap without using a couch. The only thing
the man needed was a short cord secured to his
ankle and to a ring on the compartment wall to
make sure that his breathing did not cause him to
float off. For night sleeping, Jim was told, most people
preferred using the standard sleeping-bag-type
cots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about some lunch?&rdquo; Babe asked Jim when
they had left the passenger relaxing in mid-air.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get ours before the tourists come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for it,&rdquo; Jim replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>As they &ldquo;swam&rdquo; toward the crewmen&rsquo;s mess,
Babe said, &ldquo;This is your crucial meal, Jim. If you
get by this one without anyone getting curious
about you, I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll have to worry
about them anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my fingers crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going to need all the luck he could get,
he realized, as they navigated into the mess compartment.
Across the room from them was the officer
with the square red mustache who had spoken
to him as he carried Mr. Bowers&rsquo; bags into Suite 8!</p>
<p>Jim whispered to Babe about the officer. Babe
told him that there was a good chance of avoiding
him, since the officers sat at one table and the stewards
at another.</p>
<p>Jim was fascinated by his first meal in space.
Everyone strapped himself to his seat so that he
would stay put. Then the cooks brought in individual
plates which adhered to the metallic table
top by magnetism. Each bite of food was impaled
on a toothpick stuck into a sponge-rubber mat
which was fastened to the plate.</p>
<p>As Jim ate with tongs and sucked his drink from
a closed container, he was careful to avoid the
roving eyes of the officer with the red mustache.
Jim was glad that the other stewards weren&rsquo;t inquisitive
about him. They appeared hungry and
weren&rsquo;t talkative.</p>
<p>Having survived the crucial first day without
discovery, Jim found the others that followed were
much easier. When three weeks had passed and he
still had not been discovered, he started believing
that the tourist company owner he had &ldquo;bumped&rdquo;
was not going to complain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>But one day late in the voyage Jim and Babe
happened to run into a very important person in
the corridor on the way to mess. Jim recognized
the insigne of four platinum rockets that showed
he was Captain Coppard. It was Jim&rsquo;s first face-to-face
meeting with the officer.</p>
<p>After the stewards&rsquo; salute Captain Coppard suddenly
pulled up short, and Jim felt the trim,
hawk-nosed man&rsquo;s steely gaze on him. It was a stare
that appeared to look clear through him. Why was
the officer suddenly so interested in him? It
brought an anxious lump up into Jim&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steward,&rdquo; the chief officer said, &ldquo;just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim faced the officer in gray and gold, his heart
pounding. Had Mr. Bowers radioed the ship about
him? Or had Captain Coppard found out about
him in some other way?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; Jim said.</p>
<p>Captain Coppard touched Jim&rsquo;s blouse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got a button undone on your uniform. Don&rsquo;t let
me see that again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim replied in relief, and lost no time
tidying himself. The captain &ldquo;swam&rdquo; off down the
corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scared the life out of me!&rdquo; Jim blurted to
Babe. &ldquo;I thought he had found me out for sure!
I know now why you didn&rsquo;t want me to turn myself
in yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s an expert spaceman, but he&rsquo;s as
strict as they come, just as I told you,&rdquo; Babe replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>After lunch Jim and Babe had a little time on
their hands and &ldquo;hung&rdquo; by the port in their compartment
looking out into space. By now Earth
had dwindled to an arc light, and the endless star
patterns and dusty nebulae challenged his imagination
tremendously. The planet they were heading
for was an enlarging brilliant disk that stood out
prominently among the sparkling diamonds of
black space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been out of the orphanage,
Jim?&rdquo; Babe asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over two years,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working
as an assistant athletic coach at Oceanside Boys&rsquo;
Home outside Miami since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you were doing redcap service at
the space harbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim grinned broadly. &ldquo;Just because I loved it.
I loved to go aboard space ships and pretend I was a
real passenger. I&rsquo;ve wanted to go into space ever
since I knew there was such a thing. It seems now
as though I&rsquo;m in a wonderful dream and that all
this is not really true at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause followed, as Jim looked at Babe.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never told me anything about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to tell. I&rsquo;m
thirty-two, unmarried. Been going into space since
I was seventeen. Like you, I have space in my
blood, and I hope I&rsquo;ll be rocketing until I&rsquo;m eighty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Jim had a multitude of services to do for his
patrons before the end of the trip. He had a half
dozen mild cases of &ldquo;collision,&rdquo; resulting from
tourists&rsquo; carelessly bumping into the walls of their
compartments, not realizing their increased powers
in &ldquo;free fall.&rdquo; On another occasion a traveler had
failed to hitch onto a wall ring during a nap and
had floated down the corridor half the length of
the ship. A child had a minor case of radiation burn
when he wandered into a restricted compartment
next to the atomic reactor.</p>
<p>The trip was nearly over in a few weeks&rsquo; time,
for the <i>Hercules</i> was traveling the way of the
straight line and crossing the orbits of the other
planets. The day of landing, Jim and Babe looked
out of the port in their compartment at a pearly
mist. The sensation of weight had returned with
the cutting in of the rocket motors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long before we touch down?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several hours yet,&rdquo; Babe replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to circle the planet several times to brake our
speed. If we were to go straight down through
this pea soup, the friction would turn us red hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was glad when they were dropping at respectable
speed directly down. The landing, moments
later, in the colony space harbor was made
safely.</p>
<p>After Jim and Babe had made their rounds readying
the passengers for debarkation, a voice came
over the wall microphone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steward Al Hogan, report to Captain Coppard&rsquo;s
suite right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Jim and Babe exchanged anxious glances but
did not speak as Babe left the compartment. Jim
wondered if his secret had been discovered at this
last moment. His concern was more for Babe than
for himself. It would be an awful thing for Babe to
have to pay the penalty for helping him.</p>
<p>To take his mind off his concern, Jim went to
the side port for his first sight of Venus. Although
the upper layers of the atmosphere were impenetrably
dense, the air at ground level was clear except
for occasional wisps of vapor floating by. The
intense rising heat gave a shimmering effect to the
canyon landscape. When Babe returned, he eased
Jim&rsquo;s mind with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like to make the cable-car tour with
me, Jim?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for it!&rdquo; Jim said, greatly relieved that
Babe had nothing bad to report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the regular cable-car drivers is sick and
can&rsquo;t make the trip,&rdquo; Babe went on. &ldquo;Captain Coppard
knew I&rsquo;d had experience driving the car a few
times before and asked me if I wanted to make some
overtime pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; Jim asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few hours&mdash;after the tourists have had time
to rest up from the landing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Five hours later, Jim and Babe were helping
tourists into breathing outfits. There wasn&rsquo;t enough
oxygen in Venus&rsquo; atmosphere to support life from
Earth, although the planet had animal life of its
own. The apparatus was a light helmet with an
attachment covering the nose of the wearer. The
gadget contained two slender tubes which fitted
into the nostrils and supplied them with oxygen
from shoulder tanks. Also attached to the helmet
were dark lenses for protecting the eyes from the
extreme brilliance.</p>
<p>As they left the ship, Jim saw that almost all of
the many buildings of the settlement were clustered
about the rim of the space harbor. Venus was
still in the pioneer stage of development; the only
persons living permanently on the planet were scientists,
engineers, and tourist workers. The harbor
lay on a broad, high plateau. On three sides of it,
precipices dropped away sharply into deep canyons.</p>
<p>It took Jim a while to get used to the oppressive
hotness of the atmosphere. It was like breathing fire
each time he took a breath through his mouth.
Babe instructed him and the others to breathe only
through their noses in order to avoid the discomfort.</p>
<p>Babe led the party toward one of the edges of
the plateau where the cable car rested, a hundred
feet or so from the cliff. Its overhead cable extended
out as far as Jim could see into the deep
country.</p>
<p>When all were aboard, one of the tourists,
weighted down with camera equipment, asked,
&ldquo;When are we leaving, Chief? Right away? I can&rsquo;t
wait to get this terrific scenery down on film! Isn&rsquo;t
this a fabulous place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was Mr. Benjamin, one of the more
enthusiastic travelers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving just as soon as we get the rear
jet firing,&rdquo; Babe told him. He led Jim into the
foremost of two Plexiglas-enclosed drivers&rsquo; quarters
that were located at each end of the car.</p>
<p>Jim saw that only a single lever was used to control
the cable car. There was a radio set for contact
with the space harbor if this were necessary.</p>
<p>Babe turned on the ignition and shoved the
lever. The car began gliding over the ground toward
the edge of the precipice. &ldquo;A child can run
this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One jet behind to push us forward,
one in front to slow us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim felt his knees go weak in tingling anticipation
as the car swung out into empty space, with
only its slender overhead cable as a support for
forty people. Babe presently let Jim try the control
lever. Jim could hear the hollow <i>swoosh</i> of the rear
jet as it shot the car along, and he could hear the
singing of the cable as the car rolled smoothly on
its fine overhead bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be going uphill,&rdquo; Jim commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; Babe said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading for Point
Luna, which is a thousand feet higher than where
we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they ever got this cable in
place,&rdquo; Jim said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that it wasn&rsquo;t too much of a job,
using helicopters,&rdquo; Babe explained. &ldquo;It was worth
the trouble because the tourist revenue from it has
helped the building projects here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Reaching Point Luna, the car was stopped and
the tourists got out to look over the view. The space
harbor was only a miniature tongue of land beyond
the vast spread of canyon behind them. Babe
pointed out the Great Crimson Desert in the distance,
which looked to Jim like a sea of fire as the
heat waves rose from it up into the white sky. Jim
thought it odd, not seeing a sun up there. He knew
the planet was forever shut off from any view of the
outer magnificent solar system because of its dense
atmosphere.</p>
<p>The car moved on again, and presently a flock of
snow-white birds began circling about. Jim knew
these to be the Venus albatrosses, which often accompanied
the cable car. The next peak reached
was Point Hastings, named for the man who had first
set foot on Venus. The spot was a rugged mesa jutting
up from the canyon floor. The excited party
left the car and trooped down a slope which was
thick with salmon-pink umbrella fern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready to see Venus&rsquo; most interesting and
bad-tempered animals,&rdquo; Babe had told them just
before.</p>
<p>Babe led them down to the bottom of the slope
and through a dense thicket of gorgeous orange-colored
blossoms. At this point the black rock slope
dropped away to a sandy plain covered with a herd
of giant unicorns. The animals were about the size
of elephants, with glossy tan hides and slender
antelope legs. Their huge heads carried swordlike
horns just above the nose. The unicorns were
browsing on patches of blue spider grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>Mr. Benjamin piped excitedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get
a picture of one of those babies!&rdquo; He scrambled
recklessly down the slope and took up a position
behind a large rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be careful, sir!&rdquo; Babe warned. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t take much to rile them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how the animals on Venus can get
along without breathing oxygen,&rdquo; Jim commented
to Babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a huge lung capacity,&rdquo; Babe explained,
&ldquo;and also take in what little oxygen Venus
has while they sleep. They store it up in a special
air sac inside their bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin waved his hand to attract the attention
of the beasts. Several in the herd raised
their heads and peered at the man. One of them
decided to investigate. He trotted over toward the
rock where Mr. Benjamin was clicking away with
his camera, an ugly frown on its wrinkled features.
The rock shifted unexpectedly, and the tourist slid
around the edge of it. He lost his balance and tumbled
down the slope, shouting wildly for help.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s blood chilled, but he acted promptly, darting
forward and scrambling down the incline after
the helpless man. The unicorn rushed up the slope,
his head lowered and his frightening ivory horn
poised for attack.</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin cried out and barely squirmed out
of the way of the charging animal. The force of the
unicorn&rsquo;s thrust caused him to bury his sharp horn
to the ground. He withdrew it with a grunt of fury
and shook black earth from the glossy white tip.
Then he retreated for another charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/i4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="365" />
<p class="caption"><i>The unicorn rushed up the slope, his head lowered
and his frightening ivory horn poised for attack.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; Mr. Benjamin cried desperately,
scrambling madly to get a foothold in the slipping
gravel.</p>
<p>By now Jim was within arm&rsquo;s reach of the tourist.
He braced himself against the boulder that had
settled into a hollow and strained forward to grasp
Mr. Benjamin&rsquo;s hand. Just as the man was pulled
to his feet, the unicorn struck again, burying his
horn in the ground barely inches below the tourist&rsquo;s
boots. Jim shuddered as he hurried Mr. Benjamin
up the slope to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor camera!&rdquo; the tourist groaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
down there with that animal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky not to be down there with him
yourself, Mr. Benjamin,&rdquo; Babe said grimly and led
the party back toward the car.</p>
<p>Next the car passed over the fascinating Lake of
Steam. A mist, like the sheerest of veils, rose in a
solid sheet from the depths to a height of half a
mile, shot through with every imaginable color.
Jim thought it an incredibly beautiful sight.</p>
<p>Jim took over running the car while Babe went
back with the passengers to point out more of the
picturesque wonders. Jim was surprised when suddenly
the car began roller-coasting down a steep
slope toward a forbidding dark opening in the cliff
face. Quickly he realized that this was the famous
Haunted Tunnel of Venus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Jim switched on the headlights Babe had told
him about and slowed the car with a burst of the
forward jet. Slowly the car entered the enchanted
cavern. The darkness seemed to make Jim&rsquo;s ears
keener. Presently there came to him the mysterious
sighs and groans that had given the tunnel its
name. Although he knew this was caused by wind
whistling through the opening and the shifting of
rock strata, it nevertheless caused chills to run up
his spine.</p>
<p>All at once an unexpected loud buzz from the
radio set shocked him into an involuntary cry. As
his nerves calmed, he switched on the radio and
spoke into the mike, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me speak to Steward Hogan,&rdquo; came a brisk
voice that Jim knew could belong only to Captain
Coppard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim replied.</p>
<p>He opened the door of the cabin and called
Babe. Jim saw a flashlight advance toward him
down the dark aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Captain Coppard,&rdquo; Jim whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hogan speaking,&rdquo; Babe said into the mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steward,&rdquo; the chief officer of the <i>Hercules</i> said,
&ldquo;who is the young man with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s heart seemed to give a final quiver and go
dead inside of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Vance, sir,&rdquo; Babe answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find him on my roster of personnel,&rdquo;
snapped the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t on it, sir,&rdquo; Babe admitted manfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s a stowaway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Babe said reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You realize the consequences of stowing away
on a space ship, don&rsquo;t you, Hogan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Babe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remind your young friend of it, then, so that
he will be prepared for what happens when the
cable car gets back. The two of you will return
immediately to the colony. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pall of silence for several seconds
after the captain&rsquo;s stern order. Jim could hear
Babe&rsquo;s tense breathing in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They finally caught us,&rdquo; Jim murmured, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;ll have to pay for helping me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it all over again, Jim,&rdquo; Babe said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real friend, Babe,&rdquo; Jim told him.</p>
<p>Babe went out and explained to the tourists that
they had to return at once to the space harbor. The
stewards went back to the duplicate drivers&rsquo; quarters
at the other end of the car, and Babe started
the car out of the Haunted Tunnel.</p>
<p>As they drove back, both he and Babe gloomily
silent, Jim was thinking that he had satisfied his
lifelong ambition for a short while anyway. It had
been great while it lasted.</p>
<p>After they passed Point Luna, a flock of albatrosses
gathered around the car again. The birds&rsquo;
curiosity made them bolder than usual, and some
of them flew directly in front of the car. Jim heard
sickening thumps as some of the careless birds were
battered by the speeding car. Both he and Babe
shook their heads regretfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Jim looked ahead where the space harbor was
rapidly growing closer as they swept downhill.
&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better slow down, or we&rsquo;ll go crashing
into everything down there,&rdquo; Babe said.</p>
<p>He shoved the lever to brake the car, but nothing
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; Babe shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t stop this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his imagination Jim could see them tearing
loose from the cable when they reached land and
hurtling down into the space port. The destruction
would be staggering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s plugged up the forward rocket
tube!&rdquo; Babe exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the albatrosses must have been caught
in it!&rdquo; Jim burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be that!&rdquo; Babe agreed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
one thing to do&mdash;get the bird out of there double
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;re you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb out the front of the car through the
window!&rdquo; Babe said, flinging up the pane in front
of them. The hot air swept them back as though
they had suddenly opened the door of a blast furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it easier than you can,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
lighter and slenderer.&rdquo; He was also thinking of the
debt he owed Babe for helping him all this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Babe retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the responsible
one on this tour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Jim heard a battering at the door and saw some
of their passengers trying to force themselves into
the cabin. Babe opened the door a crack and
pleaded with them for calmness. In those few seconds,
Jim acted quickly.</p>
<p>First he shut off the forward jet completely. Then
he began scrambling through the window out onto
the front of the car. The wind cut him unmercifully.
Projections across the front of the cable car
gave him handholds, enabling him to crawl downward.</p>
<p>Suddenly the driving wind ripped Jim&rsquo;s nose-piece
away and left it dangling from his helmet.
He automatically gulped in a mouthful of searing,
oxygenless air. It tore at his lungs and gagged him
suffocatingly. He held his breath, grateful for the
underwater swimming he had done at the Oceanside
Boys&rsquo; Home.</p>
<p>Jim stretched downward and reached the nozzle
of the jet tube. He shoved his hand into it. The
heat of the tube caused him to cry out in agony.
Just as he was about to give up, his burned fingers
felt something soft. Feathers. His hands plunged
forward still deeper into the tube and closed
around the mangled fowl. He tugged with all his
might and finally withdrew the broken mass. His
arm was beet red and paining fiercely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>He began the tortured climb back up into the
car. His lungs were bursting for air. Every touch of
his seared hand caused him to groan in pain. Just
as he climbed free of the tube, a burst of red flame
poured from the nozzle. With a shuddering jerk
the car began slackening speed. Jim knew Babe had
thrown on the jet&rsquo;s full power as soon as Jim had
cleared the tube.</p>
<p>When Jim reached the window, Babe leaned out
and pulled him into the car. Jim sagged in the
extra seat, staring dumbly at the nearing spaceport
plateau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we make it?&rdquo; he gasped, feeling the sharp
braking force of the forward rocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it all right&mdash;thanks to you,&rdquo; Jim
heard Babe say. Then everything whirled before
his eyes and he blacked out from lack of air and the
strain of his grueling experience.</p>
<p>When Jim recovered consciousness, he was in
the colony clinic. The arm he had thrust into the
jet tube was bandaged stiffly, and there was cooling
salve on his wind-burned face.</p>
<p>Babe was standing by the bedside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The doc said you&rsquo;d be uncomfortable
for a while, but your arm burn isn&rsquo;t too
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim saw the tall erect figure of Captain Coppard
come over. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the stowaway who so cleverly
avoided me during the voyage?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jim swallowed, his throat raw. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s gaze still held that characteristic
penetrating stare. &ldquo;Steward Hogan told me how you
came to be aboard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was ready to toss
both of you into the brig when I first found out
about you. Then since I talked to you in the cable
car, I&rsquo;ve been reviewing your record while aboard
the <i>Hercules</i>. The other stewards tell me you did
an extra fine job as a beginner without training.
And of course there were these last things you did&mdash;risking
your life to save one of the tourists from
the unicorn and then preventing what could have
been a terrible accident on the cable car. In a
measure it changes things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Jim murmured hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I condone breaking regulations!&rdquo; the
officer continued gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, sir,&rdquo; Jim said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Hogan had better thank your rockets
that I&rsquo;m in an expansive mood today,&rdquo; the officer
concluded. &ldquo;Charges dismissed.&rdquo; He then left the
room. Babe and Jim were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that, Babe?&rdquo; Jim burst out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s let
us off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it sure surprised me!&rdquo; Babe said. &ldquo;I guess
I misjudged the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bowers must have radioed the captain about
me,&rdquo; Jim mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babe shook his head. &ldquo;The captain found out
on his own. He told me that Mr. Bowers wired him
soon after blast-off that some urgent business had
kept him from leaving on the <i>Hercules</i>. He didn&rsquo;t
even have time to get his bags off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that was the main thing we were
afraid of!&rdquo; Jim said wryly. He looked up at his
friend anxiously. &ldquo;Babe, do you think the captain
will let me go back to Earth as a steward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the captain knows a good spaceman
when he sees one,&rdquo; Babe replied earnestly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think you have anything to worry about, Jim&mdash;not
from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Illustrated by Charles H. Geer</i></p>
<p>The introduction by Captain Burr Leyson
sets the pace for this exciting book
of stories dealing with the newest theories
of inter-planetary communication and the
scientific advances that might make possible
some of the adventures here
described.</p>
<p>The author of these stories, Richard M.
Elam, Jr. has been interested in science
fiction since he was a boy and, although
he has written hundreds of stories and
articles, those included in this volume
have never before appeared in book form.
The author builds his science stories
around a framework of established scientific
fact and likely possibilities. In that
way, the reader is stimulated beyond the
limits of his scientific education by the
thrilling entertainment of this exciting
volume and is encouraged to probe further
the mystery of the universe in his
studies, experiments and imagination.</p>
<p>While some of these stories, such as,
&ldquo;What Time Is It,&rdquo; are pure fantasy, most
of them are based on actual scientific
possibilities.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
